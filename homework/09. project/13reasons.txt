1 [theme music playing] ["More Than Gravity" playing] [recording] Hey, it's Hannah.
Hannah Baker.
There's not a simple explanation For the things that I feel That's right.
Don't adjust your whatever device you're hearing this on.
There's no one word To tell you why I do the things It's me, live and in stereo.
No return engagements, no encore, and this time, absolutely no requests.
Get a snack.
Settle in.
Because I'm about to tell you the story of my life.
I can't love you I'm too scared to It's not a trick that's up my sleeve It's just the heart inside me And I spend so much time fighting The man that I - She was so pretty.
- Totally.
- What is it again? - #NeverForget.
[bell rings] To think what I can't say out loud What the hell are you doing? Nothing.
I'm just Looking for something? What would I be looking for? You tell me.
Do you even know my name? - [scoffs] 'Course I do, Clay.
- Guys.
Second bell.
You're not that innocent, Jensen.
I don't give a shit what she says.
Mr.
Foley, let's go.
Get to homeroom.
You too, Mr.
Jensen.
[woman] So, there are a number of ways to get help if you need it, or if a friend does, okay? And all of this information is on the board outside of my room or outside of the main office.
It's on the Liberty High home page.
Ms.
Bradley, is it possible we could be done with all this? I mean, it's been over a week.
Isn't it healthy to, like, move on? [disgusted murmurs] Okay, everyone, thank you.
Seriously, I know, it's tragic, but I don't want to keep being reminded all the time.
It's depressing.
We're never done with it, Mr.
Pratters, which is why it's important to know the signs that someone you care for might need help.
[voice fades to echo] I mean, are they withdrawing from friends and family? Is there a change in their appearance? Are they having trouble in [Mrs.
Bradley] The group collaboration project is worth one-fifth - of your semester grade total, so - [bell rings] Okay, so, please be committed and constant and fair to each other.
I like the hair.
The short hair.
Um I liked the long hair, too.
And, um, I realize this makes me seem wishy-washy, and I should have said something the other night, and in truth I don't actually like change, but this change seems cool.
Thanks, Clay.
[Mrs.
Bradley] Clay? Clay.
[clears throat] Clay.
- Yeah, sorry, what? - [students chuckle] Are you with us? Yeah, no, I am, I'm with you.
[Mrs.
Bradley] So, between now and then, observe yourself.
Bring in information.
The students did this on their own.
We thought it just best to leave it.
I see.
I'm sorry, um Let me try this again.
You'd think there'd be a master key or something.
Yeah, there was, once.
[Mrs.
Baker] She doesn't have any stickers or pictures inside.
Why doesn't she have any stickers? - Honey, it's just a locker.
- No, it's Hannah's locker.
Why is it like that? Ma'am, I really don't know.
This is everything, then? Yes.
I mean, we can go through the rest in my office.
That way I can return the textbook.
We just need anything personal.
The lawyer said bring everything.
[Mr.
Baker] Lawyers say a lot of things.
[girls laughing, chattering outside] - [camera shutter clicks] - [door shuts] Oh.
Hey, Clay.
Hey, Tyler.
[distant whistle blowing] What? Nothing.
[camera shutter clicks] [boy] No, no, Mom, it's a stupid school e-mail.
You do not need to come ho Uh, hey, hold on.
What the fuck are you doing? [Tyler] Nothing.
Just yearbook stuff.
Get out, dude.
Hey, sorry.
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Everything's fine here.
Just stay in Aspen.
Yes, I am sure, Mother, 100 percent sure.
Put Dad on the phone.
Clay.
How are you doing, sweetie? You've been on my mind.
Hey, Courtney.
I have? Well, I just feel like we all need to be there for each other at a time like this, you know? Sure.
It's all just so sad.
It just doesn't make sense, right? No.
But, um a lot of things don't make sense.
Exactly.
So true.
Some things, you know, just don't have simple explanations, right? Right.
Yeah.
I'm glad we got to talk.
Bye.
Yeah, good talk.
[boy] Hey, Clay.
You want a ride home? Yeah, sure.
No bike today? Uh, no, Mom wanted to drive me, and, you know, talk about things.
Oh.
[engine starts] Can I play you a tape? Yeah, of course.
You're still on the old media, huh? - Uh, it's so much better.
- ["Love Will Tear Us Apart" playing] Everything was better before.
You said it, son.
You cry out in your sleep All my failings exposed And there's a taste in my mouth As desperation takes hold Is it something so good - Just can't function no more - [song fades] Like so.
Now, if they ask you if it's real butter, what do you say? It's a butter-based product.
And smile when you say it.
I know, terrifying.
But it sells the big lie.
Oh, and, uh, little trade secret: If they're cute, only put butter on the top so they have to come back for more during the movie.
Okay, uh, why? So you can chat 'em up.
Oh, chat's not really my thing.
I like it.
I think we're gonna get along.
As long as you remember I started here three weeks before you, so I have seniority, which is why I'm training you.
Which is insane if you think about it, because I just moved here two months ago and I have no idea what I'm doing.
I think it's going well.
Do you like it? Here? At the Crestmont? I find the various smells fascinating.
No, this town.
Oh, right.
Uh I don't have anything to compare it to.
I've lived here all my life.
It's like asking Han Solo "How is space?" Wow! You're an actual nerd, aren't you? I admire that.
There's courage in being a nerd.
[car horn honking] [song continues] Catch you later.
[mellow jazz playing] Dad, where's your radio thing? "My radio thing"? That thing you play CDs on when you're painting or working in the yard or whatever.
My boom box.
That really what they're called? They were.
I believe now they're called obsolete.
Uh, yeah, it's in the workshop.
It plays tapes, right? It does, last I checked.
How were things at school today? Same.
Everyone's still acting weird.
And you? Um How are you doing? Me? I'm fine.
I'm good.
So, can I I can use the boom box? Yes, of course.
The boom box.
Go.
But keep in touch.
Okay? Sure thing, Dad.
Hey, it's Hannah.
Hannah Baker.
Holy shit.
Don't adjust your whatever device you're hearing this on.
It's me, live and in stereo.
No return engagements, no encore, and this time, absolutely no requests.
Get a snack.
Settle in.
Because I'm about to tell you the story of my life.
More specifically, why my life ended.
And if you're listening to this tape you're one of the reasons why.
I'm not saying which tape brings you into the story.
But fear not, if you received this lovely little box, your name will pop up.
I promise.
Anyway, the rules here are pretty simple.
- There are only two.
- Whatcha doing? - Jesus! - Sorry.
What have we said about helicopter parenting? I didn't mean to scare you.
You were just lost in what is that you're listening to? It's, uh it's nothing.
It's for history class.
- Cassettes are history now? - Mm-hm.
Hm! Of course they are.
Can I listen? No, uh, it's dumb.
I'm gonna head up to my room.
Homework.
Clay, school emailed again today.
Which explains why Dad showed interest in my life.
You two are dangerous when you coordinate.
You know I hate being the kind of parent who asks if you want to talk about anything, but if you want to talk about anything I didn't really know her, Mom.
Didn't you two work together at the Crestmont? - Yeah, for a little while - But you didn't know her very well? Not really.
I need to get to work - Shit! - Language.
I'm sorry.
I gotta I gotta go work.
This thing is due in two days, so I gotta go.
Clay.
Slow down, hon.
It's just homework.
Yeah.
Thanks, Mom.
What the hell? [grunts] Shit.
[sighs] I have to go to Tony's.
Hold on, Tony's? Now? He needs one of the tapes.
We're working together.
Dinner's in a half hour.
Make me a plate for later? Text me if you're gonna be later than really late.
- I will.
Bye.
- Bye.
[children chattering] [horn honking] Hand me the screwdriver.
Okay.
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey, Clay.
- Something wrong with her? - Nothing wrong yet.
It's called taking care of things.
- Dad, you remember Clay.
- Yeah, sure.
How you doing, Clay? I'm well, thank you.
So, Clay, what's up? Nothing.
I was, uh I was out for a ride.
On the other side of town? That should do it.
Start her up.
- Hand me the rag.
- I'll do it.
If we got the timing right, we'll hear it.
Okay, flip the ignition.
[engine turning over] [engine revs] You hear that? That's how it should sound.
- That sounds different? - Yeah, it's different.
Are you deaf? [Tony] Sounds the same as before.
Then you are deaf.
That's so much smoother.
Like night and day.
[Tony responds indistinctly] [Tony's dad] I don't think so.
I know, and you should too.
That's why I'm showing you this.
Okay, shut her off.
[engine shuts off] I should get out of here.
Sure you don't want to stay for dinner? No, thanks.
My mom's making pork chops.
If I'm not home soon, she'll call the cops or something.
They emailed all the parents again.
- Oh, I know.
- [Tony's dad] She leave a note? Girl who killed herself? Uh I don't know.
[speaks low in Spanish] Well, you listen to me.
You ever do that to your mother, I will kill you, you understand? I'll kill you dead.
Clean this shit up.
No sense of irony in that comment.
None.
He's, uh He's a simple man.
Yep.
I'll see you later.
Clay, I think you got something that belongs to me.
I do? My keys.
Oh, yeah, right.
Here.
I'll see you later.
[Hannah] The rules here are pretty simple.
There are only two.
Rule number one: you listen.
Number two: you pass it on.
Hopefully, neither one will be easy.
It's not supposed to be easy, or I would have emailed you an MP3.
When you're done listening to all 13 sides, because there are 13 sides to every story rewind the tapes, put them back in the box, and pass them on to the next person.
Why the hell am I on this? Oh, and the box of tapes should have included a map.
I'll be mentioning several spots around our beloved city.
I can't force you to visit them, but if you'd like a little more insight, head for the stars.
Or, you know, just throw the map away and I'll never know or will I? You see, in case you're tempted to break the rules, understand I did make a copy of these tapes, and I left them with a trusted individual who, if this package doesn't make it through all of you, will release those copies in a very public manner.
This was not a spur of the moment decision.
Do not take me for granted.
Not again.
I never did! - [car horn honking] - Whoa! - [honking] - [tires squeal] [tape player clatters] [tires squealing away] [grunts] [coughs] [panting] [groans softly] Oh, shit.
[grunts] [Hannah] Do what I say.
Not more, not less.
You're being watched.
Everything okay? Yeah.
No, I just forgot something.
Clay, your forehead! What? It's nothing.
Did you fall off your bike? Low-hanging branch.
I went through the woods.
It was dark.
I'll get the first aid kit.
I don't need first aid.
You are bleeding.
You need ointment.
Mom, please don't say "ointment.
" I'm fine, really.
- What happened? - I told you, bike, branch, skin.
That's all? Mom, I tell you everything about my life because it is so fascinating, I promise.
I'll clean it up.
I have to go.
Tony's waiting.
Ah-ah.
Your helmet, please.
[Hannah] Love the helmet.
It's adorable.
You mean "adorable" in a helpless baby animal sort of way, I'm guessing.
Aren't you afraid of helmet hair? My hair does the same thing no matter what, just sits there.
You just need some product.
A little effort to style it, blow-dry it in the morning.
And sacrifice my masculinity? That ship has sailed, don't you think? Forgive me for wanting to keep my brains in my head.
Instead of, say, some other regions, like most boys? Come on, Helmet, you've got bathrooms to clean.
- You mean "we've got.
" - Mm.
I don't, actually.
Oh, uh, party at my house tomorrow night.
You're invited.
It's mandatory.
Don't bring the helmet.
Cool.
Where, uh where do you live? [Hannah] Put your finger on "C," your other finger on "4.
" Bring them together.
That's our first red star.
I know, right? A map.
Old school, again.
No Google Maps, no app, no chance for the interwebs to make everything worse, like it does.
[engine revs] [engine revs, tires squeal] [Hannah] You've arrived at my first house in this shitty town where I threw my first and only party and where I met Justin Foley the subject of our first tape.
[rock music plays indistinctly] It was just a party.
I didn't know it was the beginning of the end.
- [music continues] - [overlapping chatter] Justin, you were in love with my friend Kat.
My only friend.
He came! Clay's here! - [chuckles] - I win! You owe me five dollars.
Oh, my God.
- You bet on me? - Against you.
Last party I saw Clay at mm, my birthday, fourth grade.
- I still remember that clown.
- Mm! Oh, my God.
He was a heroin addict.
My mother the social worker hired a recovering heroin addict.
He had the shakes.
Okay, uh, drinks.
Come on.
Excuse me.
- I just thought he was nervous.
- [both chuckle] - Hey.
- Hi, Kat.
This is quite a turnout.
People are happy to see you go.
I really just threw it so Hannah could finally meet some people before I depart this realm.
I met Helmet.
Clay doesn't count.
You met him at work.
- I feel like that should count.
- Of course you do.
Okay, refills.
Clay, what is your drink? Uh, Sprite.
Oh, my God, you are priceless.
You are a gem.
You'll have a beer.
Sure, I like beer.
- [Tyler] Kat.
- Oh.
Picture.
[shutter clicks] Stop having so much fun, Clay.
I'm having fun, totally.
Woot! You're too buttoned up.
[laughing] Hey there.
Hey.
You're, um, you're the new girl.
Apparently.
Uh, I like your laugh.
Thanks.
I like your understated sense of fashion.
[chuckles] Thanks.
[Kat] Bryce.
Better go hit the keg and catch up.
You're an hour behind.
I'll see you later I hope.
See you.
Oh, God, no.
Solid no, Hannah.
He is, like, frat boy Darth Vader.
He didn't seem that bad.
I was being kind.
She kind of was.
I think I want a beer too.
Okay, then, Princess Leia.
Oh, my God, you're both nerds.
Have fun.
Are you gonna tell her? Tell her what? Oh, please.
I've known you this entire century.
Well, give me a break.
I'm not good with the you know, and the gay rumors only recently subsided.
Mmm.
So the stakes are high for you.
It's like, around her, I can be different, you know? I'm the new and improved Clay Jensen: high school sophomore, archaeologist-slash-adventurer.
Clay, sweets, you're a prize.
But from my limited observation, she has terrible taste in guys.
You won't say anything to her? Only if it comes up.
Kat! [cell phone vibrating] [phone clicks] - Shit! - Watch it! [laughing, yelling] No [Kat] Meet the boys.
Justin Foley is mine, and Zach Dempsey for you.
Zach Dempsey? Really? What? Zach's sweet? I can't see! Not the mane! Okay, yeah, he's kind of dumb, but he's the sweet kind of dumb, which is the best kind.
Yes.
Liberty High's star athletes, ladies and gentlemen.
So impressive.
Sorry, boys.
Can't have you in Hannah's house soaking wet.
Seriously? Oh, my God, look at yourselves.
Better? Improvement, for sure, but sorry, it's still a no-go.
Come on! It's not a party without us.
[Kat] We'll take our chances.
Go dry off.
Your loss, milady.
Idiots.
I can't even But they're sweet idiots.
[Hannah] So, you see, that's where the trouble began.
That smile.
That damned smile.
The one and only Kat moved away before the start of school.
She was the kind of friend that couldn't be replaced, even by falling in love with the boy she left behind.
[Justin] Hey.
- Hannah, right? - Right.
Justin.
Foley.
I saw you at the party the other night.
Yeah, I saw you too.
You're drier now.
Yeah, well, we went home and changed.
Was it profound? Huh? Your change.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Totally.
So, uh Kat's gone.
Yeah.
Sucks.
You talk to her? Yeah.
I mean, you know, like, a little.
Yeah, me too.
A little.
I, uh, should get to class.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Totally.
[chuckles] So, I'll see you around, then.
I guess you will.
Being Kat's boyfriend was kind of the only remarkable thing about you, but, Justin, you were my Kryptonite.
Zach who? [Hannah] Dempsey.
Oh! Sorry, love.
I'm learning all these new boy names, and I've dragged most of the old ones into the Trash icon in my head.
[chuckles] Yeah.
So, anyway, I know you wanted me to hook up with Zach, but But you're into Justin.
- I'm evil.
- No.
Hardly.
He's jock crack.
I get it.
He's all yours.
No, I would never Seriously, I have moved on, times 2,000 miles, and I'm dating hipsters now.
He's all yours.
[Hannah] I was an office assistant third period.
So I knew where you were third period.
[male teacher] All right, so that's just the even numbers one through 40.
You've got to show your work.
Yeah, you heard me say it: Show your work.
- [bell rings] - All right, dismissed.
Thank you.
[students chattering] Whoa! Careful, there.
I'm sorry about that.
Geometry with Bates.
No wonder you're in a hurry.
- Oh, you have him, too? - Fifth period.
- The worst ten hours of my day.
- [chuckles] Speaking of, gotta go.
[stammers] Oh, yeah, great.
Um I'll see you later? [Hannah] You will! I even decided to like basketball for you, Justin.
[coach] Good job.
There you go.
Jensen! Clay Jensen! [coach] There you go.
Move your feet! Helmet! Oh, hey.
Sorry.
Through here.
Did you get lost on your way to the library? Oh, uh Coach Patrick assigned the game for history homework, so So, sit.
Uh, yeah.
Okay.
You always stand and fidget.
It makes me anxious.
[coach] Run it again! - Tootsie Roll? - [chuckles] How can you eat those? Seriously, what does that look like to you? Like all that's good and sweet in the world.
- Mm.
- [chuckles] I didn't figure you for a sports person.
I want to get the complete high school experience.
- [buzzer sounds] - [cheering] Justin is the complete high school experience? Shut up! Don't be jealous, Clay.
You'll fill out.
Someday.
Maybe.
Is your dad also thin and nervous? Yeah, pretty much.
- [both chuckle] - [whistle blows] Whoo! Yeah! Yeah.
- Hey, Helmet.
- Hey.
Can you email me your French notes? I can't understand Madam Steinberg.
It's like she's speaking German.
Sure.
Ride home? Thanks, but no.
My chariot awaits.
Bye, Clay.
See you, Justin.
You guys go.
Whoa! No way! The bus? Yo, bus with hot girl, car with idiots? Hey, is that seat taken? You don't take the bus.
I don't? Well, then, I guess it's your lucky day.
You clearly don't lack confidence.
You clearly don't have geometry with Mr.
Bates fifth period.
You did research.
No.
Yes, I mean I don't know, maybe.
I like it.
It shows initiative.
So, could I like maybe get your number or something? Or something? So, I could give you my number or give you some fake nuclear launch codes? I'll just take your number.
- I'll just take your phone.
- Huh? One, you give me your phone, two, I put my number into it Okay, right, right, right.
- [engine starts] - No excuses now.
I'll be right back.
Where are you going? Forgot my geometry book.
Wait, I've got mine in here if you need Shit.
Hey, where the hell is this thing going? No clue.
I don't take the bus either.
Seriously? Hannah Baker! Call me! Handsome.
["Cool Blue" playing] How can you wait In the wash of the rain? - [cell phone chimes] - You're soaked to your feet Still, you said you'd wait for me And these days, they grow so old And I'll never show I thought they knew I'm fickle and slow, and I'll never do [Mrs.
Baker] Hannah.
I don't want you on the phone when there's homework.
I'm just using the calculator.
[cell phone message alert] And helping a friend with homework.
Phone.
Phone! - Do I know this friend? - Do you know any of them? [cell phone vibrating] More homework? We're just working on this math problem.
Hello, Justin.
Hannah's doing her homework.
[Justin] Oh, hi, Mrs.
Baker.
Yeah, she was totally just helping me with it.
Oh, really? What are you working on? Uh, math.
Math.
Oh.
All right, then.
Let me know if you need my help.
So, you needed help with a math problem? No.
I just said that to get you alone on the phone.
Because I've got homework of my own, and I can't just talk on the phone all afternoon.
Okay, I can call you back.
No! I I mean, uh, what problem were you having trouble with? The one about the, uh trains? The trains? Two trains leave at different times, but when do they meet? Oh! [chuckles] I get it.
Um Train "A" is leaving my house in a few minutes.
Train "B" is leaving your house In 30 minutes.
Thirty minutes seems like an awfully long time for two trains going full speed, huh? [chuckles] Eisenhower Park.
Rocket slide.
Oh, my God.
[laughs] I know what you're all thinking.
Hannah Baker is a slut.
Oops.
Did you catch that? I just said "Hannah Baker is.
" Can't say that anymore.
[laughter] Just wait, I'm gonna get you.
[shouts] [Hannah] I dreamed our first kiss would take place in the park.
I never told you that.
The dream starts with me at the top of the rocket holding on to the steering wheel.
It's still a playground rocket, but every time I turn the wheel to the left or the right, the trees lift up like they're taking flight.
[both laughing] - How was that? - That was pretty good.
- Yeah, you liked it? - Yeah.
[Justin] All right, your turn.
- [Hannah] My turn? - Yeah.
Okay.
What are you doing? Wait, wait, wait, wait, I have to get this.
- I'm wearing a skirt.
Hang on, hang on.
- [mocking] I'm wearing a skirt! I got this.
Let me just And I'm scared because I don't know how to fly.
But you're there at the bottom of the slide to catch me when I fall.
Okay, okay.
One, two, three.
- Ah! [giggles] - [phone camera clicks] - You good? - Yeah.
And that's all that happened.
We kissed.
Why? Did you hear something else? [heavy breathing] Nope.
We just kissed.
Sorry to disappoint you, but I guess now we're even.
Sort of.
[car approaching] - [engine shuts off] - [car door opens, shuts] Hey, Clay.
Hey, Tony.
You okay? Yeah, fine.
Is that my Walkman? Uh Yeah, I was gonna ask It's no sweat.
Just be careful listening while you ride, though.
You don't want to hurt yourself.
Again.
You're right.
Thanks.
Eisenhower Park.
That must mean you're about ready for side two.
Night, Clay.
Take care of yourself.
[Hannah] See, I've heard so many stories about me now that I don't know which one is the most popular.
But I do know which is the least popular.
The truth.
See, the truth isn't always the most exciting version of things, or the best or the worst.
It's somewhere in between.
But it deserves to be heard and remembered.
The truth will out, like someone said once.
It remains.
[sighs] [button clicks] - [mellow music plays] - So, thank you, Justin.
Sincerely.
My very first kiss was wonderful.
Porter wants to see me about Hannah.
Probably about this fucking lawsuit.
Did you get to first base, Justin? Get off me, I'm not saying anything.
- Second? - Fuck off.
Third? Okay, assholes.
- A picture's worth a thousand words.
- [chuckling] Public space.
That's hot.
Oh, yeah.
We're sending that shit around.
No, Bryce, stop! - [laughs] - Hey, Bryce, stop! Hey! Bryce, come on, man! [boys laughing, chattering] [bell rings] - You gonna hit that again, right? - Sure.
[cell phones chiming, buzzing] Oh, my God.
Seriously, Justin? Why would you send that? [cell phone chimes] - [gasps] - [bell rings] [Mrs.
Bradley] Okay, everyone, settle in.
- [cell phone chimes] - Today we're discussing ways to navigate difficult interactions.
[cell phones continue] People, at least a nod in the direction of our No Devices rule.
Okay? We are talking about ways to address conflicts with your peers, all right? How can we communicate more effectively without the use of emojis? All right, I need two volunteers for a little role-playing exercise.
- [cell phones continue] - People, phones, - otherwise they're going away.
- [vibrating] Last chance.
Yes, Sherri.
Thank you.
And who else? You in the back? Yes.
And Mr.
Johansen.
You'll be my volunteers.
I'll get the scripts.
Sit tight.
Everybody's gonna get a turn.
[Hannah] What came after my first kiss? Not so wonderful.
[Mrs.
Bradley] We'll continue our discussion of nonverbal signals tomorrow.
So, until then, make note, be aware.
[Hannah] I'm not angry you betrayed me.
I'm angry that I trusted you in the first place.
What the hell, Tony? Hey, Clay.
What's the deal? How do you fit into all of this? I'm not on the tapes, if that's what you're asking.
Did you help her do it? No, I did not.
- Did you know she was going to? - No.
- Then how the hell - Listen to the tapes, Clay.
Is that all I'm gonna get? Hannah wanted it done like this.
How do you know? I can't tell you that.
You have to listen.
What if I don't? What if I can't? Then it will only get worse.
Trust me.
Worse than Hannah being dead? I'll see you around, Clay.
Tony.
Am I side two? [Hannah] Hey, Helmet.
Can I eat with you? Uh, I've got geometry homework.
I don't mind.
So, communications class.
Really? Mrs.
Bradley doesn't have a clue what it was like to be our age.
"I find it best to confront the issue head-on by saying, "'Pardon me, but you really hurt my feelings.
'" I thought she had some good ideas.
Have you ever in your life been able to confront an issue head-on? Have you ever even had an issue? Yeah.
Kind of.
Or I guess being socially awkward has its advantages.
I don't think you're socially awkward at all.
I think you're just scared.
I think you're waiting.
Well, sometimes it's better to wait.
Wow.
[chuckles] Okay, meaning what? Just that, um Nothing.
I mean Pardon me, but you really hurt my feelings.
Hannah.
Hannah.
A rumor based on a kiss ruined a memory that I hoped would be special.
In fact, it ruined just about everything as you'll soon see.
["Mess Is Mine" playing] And stick around, Justin.
I'm not through with you yet.
I know you probably didn't mean to let me down.
In fact, most of you listening probably had no idea what you were truly doing, but you'll find out.
Talking like we used to do It was always me and you Shaping up and shipping out Check me in and check me out Hold on, darling This body is yours - This body is yours and mine - [bell rings] Well, hold on, my darling This mess was yours Now your mess is mine [vocalizing] Your mess is mine Your mess is mine Your mess is mine [Hannah] Turn the tape over for more.
["Love Will Tear Us Apart" playing] When routine bites hard And ambitions are low And resentment rides high But emotions won't grow And we're changing our ways Taking different roads Love, love will tear us apart again Love, love will tear us apart again Why is the bedroom so cold? Turned away on your side Is my timing that flawed? Our respect run so dry? Yet there's still this appeal That we've kept through our lives But love Love will tear us apart again Love, love will tear us apart again 

Welcome back.
So glad you're still listening.
Are you having fun? You must be wondering who's next, and why.
Is it you? What did you do? How did you end up on these tapes? Maybe you did something cruel.
Or maybe you just watched it happen.
Maybe you didn't even realize you were being cruel.
Maybe you didn't do anything at all.
And maybe you should have.
Too late.
I think you know exactly what you did.
And after these tapes, you'll never forget it.
I know I won't.
Oh, and, uh, by the way I'm still dead.
Clay, you're gonna be late.
I made breakfast.
You you did what? We're all having breakfast together this morning.
Oh.
- We are? - Are you awake? - Are you alive? - Yeah, I'm alive.
Door closed.
I have to be able to see you to know you're alive.
- It's a minimum requirement.
- You heard my voice.
I heard indistinct mumbles.
Well, you take what you can get in this life, Mom.
Shower, then breakfast.
Downstairs, please.
Friendship.
It's complicated.
But don't worry.
You won't go through this alone.
That's not fun.
Trust me.
I've been there.
Now, it won't always be easy.
It might even hurt a bit.
Or a bit more than a bit.
That depends on you.
But fear not, we'll get through this.
Step by step, tape by tape.
You and me.
Together.
And don't forget there are others.
Eggs'll be ready in a minute.
Dig into the French toast.
Want cream with that? It's all right.
You don't drink coffee.
I don't eat breakfast either, so It has been almost two weeks since we sat for dinner together as a family.
I am nothing if not a realist, so I am proposing that we have family breakfast every day instead.
We just each have to get up a little bit early.
How early did you have to get up? Yesterday? We won't do the full spread every day, but it's nice to start off right.
So, how'd your project end up last night? With Tony.
Fine.
For history, right? Yeah, uh, it's, um, it's this oral history project, about, like, students who came before us and stuff.
Clay, we know the last few weeks have been hard.
I stopped taking these two years ago.
Dr.
Ellman said you could have them available if needed.
They're not.
And they're probably, like, expired anyway.
It's a new prescription.
I gotta go.
I need to get ready for school.
Don't forget your lunch! Might've been a more subtle way to introduce the idea.
He's keeping secrets.
He's 17.
I'd be worried about him if he weren't keeping secrets.
Secret-keeping is learned behavior.
As is the silence.
See, I can guarantee that one of the reasons you're still listening is that you really want to know who are the others? Who else is responsible for my death? Well, you're going to learn soon enough.
And, of course, they're going to learn about you, too.
It they haven't already.
What? Feeling paranoid? On edge? Yeah.
High school does that to a person.
You never really know who you can trust.
And who you can't.
Think fast.
Don't stop moving.
It's hot potato, fellas.
Hot potato! Don't hold that ball too long.
So keep your wits about you.
It's all part of the game.
But, remember, it's not a game.
Not at all.
Hey.
Skinny kid.
Closed practice.
Out.
Sorry, I just, uh Is Justin here? Justin Foley? We've got this assignment, and Who are you? Clay Jensen.
I'm in your fifth-period history class.
Oh, yeah, quiet kid.
Yeah.
So, uh, is he here? He's not.
And he wasn't here yesterday.
He'd better be here for this pep rally today.
So, if you see him, tell him his ass gonna be running suicides until the lights go out.
I will.
If I see him, I'll tell him.
Sorry to interrupt your practice.
Hey, Jensen.
- Yeah, Coach? - Tell me something.
Justin he in any kind of trouble? I don't know.
Okay.
Tell him to come and see me.
No matter what, I'm here, okay? Zach, you're in.
All right, let's run it again! - Keep up the pace.
- Go, go! Okay.
Enough with the small talk.
It's time to meet the star of Tape One, Side B.
So, without further ado, let me introduce my former friend.
Step up, Jessica Davis.
You're next.
Hey.
Where the hell is Justin? I don't know, Jess.
You don't know? Probably just skipping first, sleeping in.
Did he ride with you guys today? No.
So, where is he? Marcus? Did you see him last night? Yeah, yeah, he was at practice.
Why won't he answer my calls or texts? I'm sure he'll be there.
Oh, you're sure.
Thanks, Marcus.
Mr.
Porter wants to see me now.
He left a call slip in my homeroom.
Miss Davis.
Don't you have a class to get to? Tell him I need to talk to him.
Now.
What you listening to, Clay? Miss Davis.
Hey, Clay.
- Oh.
Hey, Sheri.
- How's everything? Everything is everything.
I saw you and Coach Patrick this morning.
What a jerk, right? Well, kind of.
I You were looking for Justin? Have you seen him? No, but Jessica's a bit freaked because she's his cheer escort to the assembly, and she missed the morning run-through looking for him.
This is her first event with the squad, and her round-offs are a bit shaky, so - Well, that's worrisome.
Yeah.
- Right.
Why were you looking for him? No reason.
Just homework.
This is me, so Clay.
Clay, are you sure you're okay? I'm trying to be.
Yeah.
You know, I miss her, too.
A lot.
You and Hannah were friends.
Well, you know, friendship's complicated, but we were, yeah.
She ever tell you Did she ever say anything about me? Hm? Anything bad? God, no! No, Clay, she liked you so much.
Shoot.
German.
I can't be late.
Uh We should get coffee or something sometime.
Monet's? Yeah, sure.
Be great.
I met Jessica a couple of weeks into sophomore year.
Apparently, we needed to be counseled.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Mrs.
Antilly? - Yeah.
Me, too.
- Any clue why? - None.
My new students! Come in! Come in! Did you two get a chance to meet outside? Hannah, meet Jessica.
Jessica, meet Hannah.
You're both new to Liberty, and I thought it would be good for you to know each other.
I thought, and I know this isn't how things are usually done, but I thought you could be friends.
Do adults understand how friendships work? Now, I recognize it's unusual to assign someone a friend, so think of it as a friendly face in a crowd, until you get your bearings.
So you want us to smile at each other in the hall? And how will that help us, like, directionally? Well, the point is, you won't be strangers.
Starting at a new school can feel overwhelming.
I just want you to have an ally.
Two allies.
Count me in as well.
So, just to be clear, we should smile at you in the hallway too? Sure! I'd love that! Listen.
I'm not under any illusion that this school is a friendly place.
I'd like it to be.
It isn't always, but we three, we can be there for each other! That's all.
Mrs.
Antilly, I'm sure Hillary is awesome, but If we're gonna be great friends, you should know my name is Hannah.
- What did I call you? - Hillary.
That's not your name? No.
Hannah.
Crap.
I already got your best friend necklace engraved with "Hillary.
" Any students named Hillary we can set up with Jennifer? - Jessica.
- Sorry.
Jezebel.
No problem, Harriet.
Ooh.
Can I actually get a Jezebel? She'd be an amazing friend.
See? See, the senses of humor on you two.
It's a perfect match! - Yeah.
- Clearly.
Hey, Helmet.
Hey.
Why are you smiling? Why shouldn't I smile? No, I mean, you should.
I was just asking if there was an immediate recent cause or something? You literally can manufacture an existential crisis out of thin air.
It's a gift! It's a true gift.
Hey.
Is this yours? Thanks, Mr.
Porter.
Haven't seen one of these in a long time.
What you listening to? Um My dad had some tapes.
Um Old music.
Ultravox? Duran Duran? Yeah, sure.
Good stuff, man.
I do more jazz myself, but music is all good.
It gets you through the day.
Here you go.
Um Listen, Clay, I would like to talk to you sometime about Hannah Baker.
Um Hannah? Why? I'm just trying to understand what happened.
I know you guys were friends.
You worked together, right? Yeah.
Um But, I mean, yeah.
Just come by my office and we'll just talk sometime, all right? - Mm-hmm.
- All right.
Mr.
Porter was the replacement for Mrs.
Antilly, who moved to another school district.
Which, as it turns out, was very unfortunate.
That's for another tape.
Hey, Joanne.
Hazel.
Hey.
Are you following me? Um, I'm ahead of you.
Fair point.
This is a disaster.
We're walking in the same direction.
Pretty much the end of the world.
Impossibly Perky Counselor Lady can't turn out to be right.
How many cats do you think she has? Five? Seven? I was thinking 12.
And they're all, like, obese and purr Really loud.
- Where you going, anyway? - Home.
I live on Bristol.
You? I'm going to Monet's for a hot chocolate.
Hot chocolate.
Intriguing.
Especially as the day is warm.
Hot chocolate is the cure for all things shitty in life.
Huh.
I got shit that needs curing, too.
Thus began the story of Monet's, the story of a friendship.
Yeah, Kat was the best.
When she moved, I just Yeah, well, it sucked.
I leave friends behind every two years.
We're always moving.
Parents on the lam? Dad in the Air Force.
So you're always the new kid.
I had this friend, Amy.
I told her everything, including my series of embarrassing sex dreams featuring various Avengers, including Scarlett Johansson.
Then one day, you know, the moving trucks come.
I'm like, "Bye! Don't tell anyone about that Scarlett Johansson thing!" But she posts about it because that's the only communication you have anymore.
And it ends up getting around your new school.
And gets completely twisted.
So you end up That Girl.
I am so That Girl.
I'm That Other Girl.
Stupid Mrs.
Antilly.
Bitch is good at her job.
It was a hot chocolate friendship, good for cold months, but maybe not perfect for all seasons.
What? - Jessica.
Hey, Jessica.
- What, Clay? Why are you avoiding Mr.
Porter? I don't know what you're talking about.
You took off when you saw him.
Does he know about the tapes? Are you crazy? Shut your mouth.
I'm just trying to figure this out.
Then listen, don't talk.
But what happened to Justin? Why isn't he here? I don't know.
Mr.
Porter pulled him in yesterday, then he walked out of Porter's office and out of school and vanished.
Is everything okay with you guys? You're together, right? Yes, we're together, and we're fine, okay? Thank you, Clay.
- I didn't mean to - Forget it.
Just don't believe everything you hear.
Okay? For a while, we were the kind of friends you wish you had.
We did disgusting things like shop together.
Sorry! And compare what we bought.
That top is perfect for you.
It shows too much of my arms.
They're so fat.
They're not.
I have substitute teacher arms.
And talk about boys.
Uh-oh.
We've got a stalker.
Where? Play it cool.
Three o'clock.
It's after three.
No, three o'clock.
Directional.
Oh, my God, your dad is a fighter pilot.
He's a logistics expert, mostly.
Look over there.
He's checking you out.
- He's checking you out.
- No, you, and he's cute.
- He's alone.
- So? So that means he doesn't have any friends.
That's weird.
We didn't have any friends two weeks ago.
Um Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
We saw you staring at us and wondered which one of us you were checking out.
Oh, I wasn't.
Oh, come on, don't play dumb.
Do we look dumb? No.
I mean, no.
Have you ever heard of the male gaze? The? No.
Well, we have.
And we're not totally sure what it means, but you have it.
You should at least explain why you're sitting alone.
My friend thinks that makes you weird.
Are you weird? Well, I can't objectively answer the "weird" thing, but I'm sitting alone 'cause I just moved here.
I don't know anybody.
What's your name? It's Alex.
Alex Standall.
Okay, Alex Alex Standall we are prepared to invite you to our table if you can answer one question.
What is depicted on the giant painting they just hung on that wall? Uh.
It's a giant bleeding man? Or squid? Or man-squid.
Uh In spring.
Good enough.
You're in.
Okay.
Thanks.
Uh, what am I in, exactly? If you have to ask, you don't know.
And just like that two became three.
It's for my food blog.
And, like, before you know it, you're best friends.
Mr.
Jensen.
Not so fast, young man, you're wanted at the office.
Why? What for? Surprisingly, they don't send a complete explanation.
They send a summons.
Attendance.
So, I guess this has to do with your attendance.
What is it? Daily report.
You're on attendance alert starting this week.
Attendance alerts? You need to make sure you are marked present by all teachers, and the first two weeks, they have to note your participation.
But why am I on these? I have good attendance.
Someone wants to make sure you keep it that way.
I'm supposed to present a project with Justin Foley, and he wasn't here for homeroom.
Did he have a late admit? I can't release information on another student.
- Another doctor's note, Alex? - Yep, another one.
It's the same doctor.
Okay.
Hey, man.
Hey, Clay.
How are you doing? How am I doing? How are you doing? Yeah.
Females! Male! I have concluded that this school sucks! Except for you guys.
We fully support your conclusions.
Let's discuss this in our office this afternoon.
Wait, our office? My God.
Monet's.
Oh, right.
I love it.
There was nothing two hot chocolates and Alex's coffee drink du jour couldn't fix.
F.
M.
L.
Why? What happened? I got put in remedial math because my math from my old school is not the same math they have here.
Who knew that there was different math? But I bet there's a hot troubled bad boy in remedial math.
He broods, he wears leather, he's got a past he doesn't talk about and trouble with long division.
There are a couple of pregnant girls.
Will your parents freak? My dad would freak.
Yeah, my mom might, but my dad's a cop, so as long as I stand up straight and pass P.
E.
, go shooting with him Wait, your dad's a cop? And you go shooting with him? With guns? How did I not know about this? You never asked, I guess.
I love a man in uniform.
I would like to meet your father.
Ew.
And your dad wears a uniform.
Oh, yeah.
I never thought about that.
You need friends.
Even just hot chocolate friends.
Especially when your life goes to shit.
Day after day, drink after drink, we lifted our mugs and we lifted each other.
F.
M.
L.
- F.
M.
L.
- F.
M.
L.
Ew.
Cappuccino fingers.
Sorry, sorry.
- Fuck Justin.
- You don't even have to talk about it.
Ever.
Okay.
Okay.
Did you guys take that Vocational Interests and Aptitude Test? We got our results back today, and I'm suited to be In spite of our differences, we were what we each needed at that moment in time.
Three drinks against the world.
Two hot chocolates, and whatever the hell Alex was drinking.
What the hell is that? I'm working my way through the menu.
I'm committed to this.
God, you're weird.
No, I'm a searcher.
The fact that you just called yourself a searcher is weird.
Something's up with you today.
My dad's being deployed again.
- Oh, man.
I'm so sorry, Jess.
- Wow, that sucks.
He'll be in the Middle East somewhere, and he can't tell us where, probably because it's some country we're not supposed to be at war with.
F.
M.
L.
forever.
F.
M.
L.
forever.
F.
M.
L.
forever.
I'm not great at math, but here's one thing I learned for sure: one plus one plus one is not a simple equation.
Alex was the first to stop coming.
He found some other friends.
He traded up.
We were still friendly in the halls, but that's it.
Then it was down to Jessica and me.
But then, Jessica stopped coming, too.
We all went our separate ways.
Or so I thought.
I'm surprised, you know? - Yeah.
- I mean, the other day, I'm handing out the family dynamics papers, and I see hers.
Mmm.
I swear to God, I just about lost it.
Yeah.
I imagine.
It's still fresh.
I know.
I mean, I've been losing sleep.
I had Hannah in my class two years in a row.
How many students do you have, Pam? Hm? - That's not the point.
- Over 200.
I have 600 on the advisory list.
That's not That shit'll kill you, you know.
You got a salad from McDonald's, the people who make the Big Mac.
Are you fat-shaming my salad? You called my lunch a murderer.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
Can I ask you a super-needy, when-did- I-become-this-kind-of-girl question? Oh, my God.
Unfreeze.
It's not about my period.
Okay.
Do you think I could ever be as pretty as Jessica Davis? Great.
Thanks.
Got it.
No, I-I just I mean, yeah, Jessica's pretty and all, but you're special.
Special.
Like retarded.
Did I say retarded? I didn't say retarded, and I don't think we're supposed to use that word anymore.
Regardless I saw you try to be kind and, you know, fail.
Wait, I didn't Wait, how did this conversation go so wrong, so fast? It's how you're socialized.
I keep thinking you're some different kind of male.
Clearly, there's no such thing.
Enjoy your movie.
Hey.
You're here? No, I'm animatronic.
You don't work Wednesdays.
- I'm covering for Karen.
- Oh, okay.
Yeah.
That's cool.
I guess.
She's in a junior college play, A Few Good Men, which is so not the story of her life.
- Oh, thanks.
- Put it away.
What good is having a best friend who works at the movies if you can't get in for free? - Hey, Hannah.
- Hey, Alex.
Fancy seeing you here.
Hey, you work Wednesdays? Covered this.
Jess can fill you in.
Oh, yeah, we were, um we were just hanging out.
Together.
So I see.
Cool.
Um So, could I get one? Ten dollars, please.
Oh.
Um Here you go.
Enjoy your movie.
Please, let us know if we can make your visit more pleasant.
Okay.
It was fine, Jess.
It was.
You're the kind of girl that boys like to like, not spread rumors about.
You're the nice girl, the kind that becomes a cheerleader.
Hey there, Liberty Tigers, it's an exciting day at Liberty High.
Our varsity basketball team is kicking off its pre-season today, the first step on the road to returning to the state finals! By Liberty tradition, I'm happy to welcome to the podium the winner of this year's Captain's Award to introduce the varsity squad.
Walker! Now, this season's winner is co-captain of the football team and the baseball team, and was called "an inspiration to his entire team, friend to all "a tough mother-bleep " and a true born leader," and I am delighted to bestow the Liberty High Captain's Award on Bryce Walker.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Ah, it's an honor, and I'm proud to be a Liberty student athlete.
Go Tigers! Now, this year's starting lineup Willem Barclay! Zach Dempsey! Justin Foley! Anders Anderson! J.
B.
Garrison! How could you do this to me? Call me back, or at least text me.
Jessica? What, Clay? What do you want? - We need to talk.
- No, we don't.
We have to tell someone about Justin.
Like, Mr.
Porter.
Mr.
Porter? Really? That's a fantastic idea.
Does he know about the tapes? I will say it one more time.
Keep your mouth shut, got it? - Jess - Back off, Clay! Leave me alone.
When Jessica has something on her mind, she lets you know.
- What? - We need to talk.
And I knew what she wanted to talk about.
Alex's list.
Hey, Clay.
What's up, man? Hey, Marcus.
- Need a ride? - Where you going? - I'm good.
I got my bike.
- Just throw it in the trunk.
We're gonna go hang at Bryce's.
You should totally come.
Hey, Clay.
You all right? Yeah, thanks.
You sure? Yeah.
You heard him, boys.
He's all right.
You see, that's just how it works in high school.
Boys talk, girls listen and everything gets messed up.
Or at least that's how it was with us.
Right, Jess? F.
M.
L.
? I should have known.
I know the rumors, Hannah.
Well, you can't know rumors.
You can hear them, but you can't know them.
We were friends.
How could you betray me like that? Like what? What did I do? Is it you and Alex now? No! How could you even Of course not! He likes you, you like him.
I'm the one who's out.
Yeah, and that pissed you off, didn't it? A little.
I mean It made me sad.
Why didn't you just tell me? Maybe I was afraid of something like this.
Something like what? You needed it to be my fault so it was my fault.
Jess.
You know this doesn't mean anything.
- Don't act innocent.
- But I am.
I had nothing to do with this.
Alex did this on his own.
He just broke up with me on his own.
I didn't know he broke up with you.
I'll just say this: enjoy it.
'Cause you will, won't you? 'Cause that's what sluts do.
Fuck you.
Friendship.
It's complicated.
Is it working? The hot chocolate? No.
Why did you and Hannah fight? I don't get it.
Of course you don't.
You're a guy.
You guys were friends.
We weren't friends.
Friends tell the truth, friends don't turn on each other.
Hannah's a user and a liar.
You can't believe anything that she says.
Not a thing.
I mean, what she said, on the tapes, about us and Monet's, she's the one who stopped coming, not me.
She's the one who ended our friendship, and she knew it.
She's a liar.
Was a liar.
Why would she lie? Why do you think? I don't know.
I don't understand any of this.
I mean, I know people talk.
Relationships start.
They end.
I guess I always thought, "How much does high school stuff really matter?" But I mean, it does.
But, you know, it We're only here for four years.
If you live that long.
Can I ask you something? Zach and Marcus really wanted to give me a ride just now at school.
So? So that's never happened before.
They even invited me to hang at Bryce's.
At Bryce's? Oh, my God.
Of course they did.
Any idea how I acquired these new friends? They're not your friends.
Official word is he's not here.
Yeah, well, Coach is looking for him now, too.
He's fucking pissed that he missed the assembly.
He's in the pool house.
Stoned off his gourd, by the way.
He's been here all day? Yeah, since last night.
What'd he do? Who the fuck knows? Yo, man.
You okay? Fuck you, am I okay.
What are you, my bitch now? Close the frickin' door.
Hey, Jessica's looking for you.
She looks bad.
Yeah, she has for a while.
You gonna talk to her? And say what? Tell her to get her shit together.
She's acting like a nut job, drawing attention to herself.
And you.
Not me.
I ain't there.
You need a refill? You're parked in a loading zone.
I'm not staying long.
That was the table, yeah? Don't pretend you don't know.
You listened to the tapes.
You had to.
Who else has? I'm not here to tell you that.
Then why are you here? Clay, you're the slowest yet.
What is taking you so long? It's hard.
To listen.
Of course it is.
It's tapes from a dead girl.
Doesn't this affect you at all? More than I can tell you.
Why can't you tell me? You remember seventh grade? Those fucknuts stuck your head in the toilet and that shit? Yes.
And I told you that me and my brothers could fix it, and you said, "Sometimes, a guy's gotta get through things on his own.
" I remember.
This is one of those things.
I can't hear her voice without thinking of her.
Without seeing her.
Seems like maybe that was the idea.
It's all you, bro.
- You are such a fucking asshole! - Hey! - Come on! Hey! - How could you do that to me? - What did you tell him? - What did I tell who? Mr.
Porter! What did you tell him yesterday? Why haven't you been at school? I just needed a day off to chill.
They day after you talk to Porter, you need a day off? You're not telling me something! What would I not be telling you? Clay has the tapes now.
I know.
Don't worry about it.
He's not like the rest of us.
He could say something.
He won't talk.
We'll make sure of it.
You could lose your shot at a scholarship.
We'll deal with it, okay? Just Just chill! How far is he, anyway? He's not there yet, if that's what you mean.
Justin? If Hannah was lying why are you here? Losing a good friend is never easy especially when you don't understand why you lost them in the first place.
Andy.
Andy! It's nothing.
If anything, it's a compliment.
A compliment? I don't think so.
Well, you remember what we saw on her Facebook, the texts? She had some unkind classmates.
She was bullied.
This is bullying! I'm not sure the court will see it the same way.
- With everything else - What else? Some text messages? Facebook posts? Online comments? A picture of our daughter on a playground with anonymous insults that might have come from anywhere.
We have no idea what that means, or who wrote it, or where it came from.
We have to find out.
What if we find out something we don't want to know? I know our daughter.
Are you sure? Hi, um, it's Olivia Baker.
I'm sorry to bother you again.
You've done so much for us already, but, well, we found something inside one of the books in Hannah's locker, and we we don't know what it is, so I was hoping that maybe you could tell us.
Sure, Mrs.
Baker, I can be right over.
Yeah, no problem.
Yes.
All right, bye.
Like I said it's complicated.

1 [theme music playing] ["Doing It To Death" playing] [Hannah] You've heard of the butterfly effect, right? That if a butterfly flaps its wings at just the right time in just the right place it can cause a hurricane thousands of miles away.
[woman] Hold on.
Is Justin here? Haven't seen him for days.
I thought he was with you.
He told me he was going home last night.
Yeah, well, he didn't.
- [man] Who is it, Am? - Justin's girlfriend.
[sighs] Girlfriend, huh? Tell that little shit that his mother is worried sick, all right? Yeah.
She looks it.
Tell him call her today or don't bother coming home.
Heads up We're in a dead club [Hannah] It's chaos theory.
But, see, chaos theory isn't exactly about chaos.
It's about how a tiny change in a big system can affect everything.
Doing it to death - Fuck! What the fuck? - [laughs] Dude, it's time to wakey.
I'm rolling in ten, if you feel like school.
Oh, shit! - What's with the fucking water? - Just having some fun.
[mocking] "I'm just having some fun.
" Justy, you know you're welcome here all the damn time, buddy, but I thought you were going home last night.
Yeah, that guy Seth is back.
- Meth Seth? - Yeth.
[both laugh] And that's all, right? Just Meth Seth? Yeah, just that asshole.
I can't deal with him, you know that.
'Cause your girlfriend's texting me now.
Brother, you know that Seth or whatever, I got your back, always.
Yeah, I know.
Whatever you did, if you even fucking did anything, we can take care of it.
I mean anything.
You know my one rule.
Keep you clean.
Keep me clean.
All right.
And Jessica, take care of her, all right? She's your girl.
You want some breakfast? Marisa the maid's here making some Mexican shit.
[chuckles] You know she's Guatemalan, right? Sure.
- Hungry? - Yeah.
[Hannah] Chaos theory.
Sounds dramatic, but it's not.
Ask a mathematician.
Or better yet, ask someone who's been in a hurricane.
We're double sixing it Night after night after night We're double sixing it Night after night after night Wanna help? Do I want help? Do you want to help? Put up posters.
No, no thanks, Marcus.
Come on, school spirit.
All right? Making a contribution.
Giving back.
Giving back to who, exactly? [band warming up] Why are they playing in the courtyard? Uh, yeah.
They asked student council.
Thought it was a great idea.
Got a concert tonight.
We got some glum chums.
[Hannah] Alex Standall.
You caused the hurricane.
It's your turn.
F.
M.
L.
forever.
F.
M.
L.
forever.
F.
M.
L.
forever.
[Hannah] Little did I know you would F.
my L.
forever.
Little did I know you would be my hurricane.
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey.
- You okay? - Yeah, I just I overslept.
Mr.
McLean wants us to start with "Take Five.
" - He thinks that'll raise spirits.
- Love me some Brubeck.
Though of course it was written by Paul Desmond, but whatever.
If they want a spirit-raiser, how about "Gloomy Sunday"? Are you serious? That song's totally depressing.
Or it's beautiful, if you have taste.
Or if you're suicidal.
Way to go, Troy.
Aw, shit.
Was he friends with Hannah Baker? I didn't know.
[Hannah] Maybe you think I'm being silly.
I'm some stupid girl who gets all worked up over a little thing.
But little things matter.
For instance, you never told me when you started dating Jessica.
But I remember just how it ended.
- With your list.
- [sighs] Is "Gloomy Sunday" really a song? Yeah.
Google "Hungarian Suicide Song.
" I'll take your word for it.
Alex.
Can we, um talk about this? What is there to talk about? - Is Hannah telling the truth? - What do you think? Did you do what she said you did? Did you? Alex.
"Take the 'A' Train," with your solo.
All right, well, I guess if I'm gonna be happy, may as well do it with the Duke.
- [drumsticks tapping] - [band playing mellow rock] [Hannah] Alex, we hadn't talked since you two got together.
And then it seemed like maybe you might not be together anymore.
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey.
Mrs.
Antilly? Yeah.
Everything okay? What, like in the world? Or with you.
Yeah.
You could drop by our office later, if you want to make a full report.
Our office? Monet's.
Oh.
Yeah, right.
I forgot about that.
The office thing.
Yeah.
It's been a while.
Yeah, there's just so much going on.
Male! Females.
Hey, how about a Monet's reunion today? You have a few drink selections left on your great menu journey.
You were so committed once.
Yeah, commitment's hard for Alex.
At least I have the ability to try something new in life.
[Hannah] Is that why you did it, Alex? Mrs.
Baker.
Hi.
I wasn't expecting you.
Olivia.
Please.
Yeah.
Well, come on in.
Thank you for making the time.
I-I, uh I know how busy you are.
No, not at all.
- [shuts door] - What can I do for you? Well, I was, um, I'm wondering if you could tell me something about Hannah's school life.
I mean, was she unhappy here? Well I don't think I can answer that.
I know you can't possibly know every student, but my husband and I, we're still trying to understand.
At home, Hannah was Well, I mean sometimes she would run around the house singing show tunes in funny voices and showering us with hugs, and other times she was quiet and moody and it'd be hard to get a word out of her.
- Sure.
- But nothing she did told us she was capable of I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop you right there, Mrs.
Baker.
I'm terribly sorry for your loss, and I wish I could offer you what you need, but I just can't.
Now that lawyers are involved.
What are you saying? What I'm saying is that, in light of your lawsuit, I shouldn't even be talking to you.
I see.
So then why are you? You and your husband are members of our school community, and we want nothing more than to support you during this time.
I can only imagine your grief.
You can't imagine the first thing about my life right now.
- [sobbing] - [door opens] - [girl 1] Bryce is a total vampire.
- [girl 2 chuckles] That thing on your neck is huge.
Oh, I know, right? [exhales sharply] [gasping breath] [whimpers] [Hannah] Maybe you say it's nothing, Alex.
It's just words.
[sniffles] [camera shutter clicks] [camera shutter clicks] Seriously, Tyler? If you're going to do a memorial, I'm going to take pictures.
Mrs.
Baker.
Hi.
I'm Courtney Crimsen.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
I hope you like it.
People keep adding to it.
Um, every day there's another card or more flowers.
All these people were Hannah's friends? Mm-hmm.
She had so many friends and we all miss her so much.
Anyone who knew Hannah would know that she hated roses.
She thought they were a clichÃ©.
[bell rings] ["Whatever You Want" playing] [Clay] Hannah.
Hey, Hannah.
- Hey.
- Morning, Helmet.
Urgent question.
Have you noticed anything weird about Alex lately? Um Well, his hair's weird, but that's not new.
His hair is awesome.
I didn't say it wasn't awesome, it's just, like, distinctive.
And he's an amazing dresser.
I mean, you could take a few lessons.
I totally could.
And I'm glad we got around to my failings because I was wondering when we would get to that.
Are you working tonight? Yeah, we're both on at six.
I mean, I think.
On the schedule.
So, speaking of tonight, I don't know if you know this, but there's a penumbral lunar eclipse at 11:49.
A what? The Earth's shadow is the penumbra.
Tonight, the moon is gonna pass through it.
Last show is at nine, and if we clean fast, and we probably can, because no kids are coming to that English movie because it's boring, we could get out in time, and I could maybe point it out to you.
If you want.
You want to show me the moon? There would be a shadow.
Not like a full eclipse.
You wouldn't exactly see the But, yeah.
[chuckles] You should, like, patent yourself.
And, yes, I will look at the moon with you.
I might even howl.
Cool.
Cool.
So, yeah, I'll see you tonight.
[locker doom slams] Anyways, is Justin still missing? He's not missing.
I know exactly where he is.
[sighs] So he's at Bryce's.
Maybe you should go.
I shouldn't have to go.
He should be here.
Then go get him.
Drag him back to school by his perfect hair.
Right.
You know what? Tell him that you entered him into that costume contest.
Two hundred bucks.
Yeah, maybe he could dress up as my actual boyfriend.
[Mr.
Porter] I spoke to Justin, but now I need to speak to Alex Standall.
He dated Jessica Davis, who I spoke to yesterday.
Justin Foley the day before.
There was this rumor that Justin and Hannah had sex in a park.
Justin said it was all a big joke, and Hannah blew it out of proportion.
Did you follow it up? Justin's been absent for the past two days.
[principal] Did you call home? [Mr.
Porter] No answer.
I spoke with Coach Patrick.
Apparently, it's just his mom and a series of step-dads and boyfriends.
Coach thinks there may have been abuse at some point in the past.
- [principal] At home? - [Mr.
Porter] Yes.
[doorbell rings] [doorbell continues] Hey.
[sobs] [principal] And Jessica Davis? As I understand it, she was Hannah's first friend here.
Uh, now she's Justin's girlfriend.
So, I imagine she protected him.
Could be, or she doesn't know anything.
She didn't say much.
This lawsuit could cost the district tens of thousands, hundreds, and that's if we win.
We're already getting calls from the media.
Yeah.
I understand.
And she never came to you, for help? We had a meeting last year about colleges.
All the time and resources we've dedicated to her now.
If we'd known she needed help before [Coach Patrick] All right, young people.
- Let the learning commence.
- [TV music] We've got a film today, continuing on our World War II unit.
It's full of facts, even though technically it's fiction.
No talking, no texting.
[snorts] No sleeping.
Ironic, as he will sleep through the whole thing.
Right? Remember when he showed Gladiator for Roman history? Oh, yeah.
Seriously, John Wayne? Shh.
- You're gonna disturb his nap.
- [chuckles] Cover me if he wakes up.
Okay.
[coughs] [Hannah] Maybe, Alex you were just being a dick.
- Alex - Go back to class, Clay.
What are you doing? I'm cleaning up.
What, they think these are gonna save someone's life? "Suicide's not an option"? Yeah, you know what? Clearly it is an option, you know? Why don't they put up a poster that says "Don't be a dick"? Why don't we put up that poster? Yeah, that would be cool with me.
I try not to be a dick.
Yeah, we all try.
So, did you do it? What Hannah says you did to her and Jessica.
- What do you think? - [Tyler] What are you doing? I'm recruiting Clay for the Illuminati.
You want to join? Alex, you should not joke about the Illuminati, first of all.
Trust me.
What are you guys talking about? Homework.
We've got a project.
Yeah, right.
The old project trope.
The only class you two have together is gym.
It's creepy that you even know that.
Just go away.
What I think is that you wouldn't do something like that.
I thought you loved Jessica.
I did.
I mean Maybe I even still do, but - Then why would you - We can't be talking about this.
Guys.
Where are you supposed to be? That's a heavy question.
That's, like, existential.
Alex.
Why don't you come with me.
I been wanting to talk to you.
Okay.
Clay, you can come along too.
Uh, Coach Patrick sent me to the library.
He has the wrong DVD for today, so the whole class is waiting.
All right.
Let's catch up later.
Find anything worth publishing? Oh, hardly.
Just the usual angst, despair, lovelorn crap.
Uninspired.
But I am planning a special issue in memory of Hannah Baker.
Maybe you have something to add? Uh, no, not really.
He's still in there.
Is he okay? The credits ended five minutes ago.
Here he comes.
Good night, I guess.
No Jessica tonight? Uh, no.
So, you all good, man? Yeah.
See you guys.
[cell phone chimes] You do ticket count, I'll do concessions.
Ten minutes to go! [both laugh] - [Clay] Yep.
I got you.
- [Hannah] Okay.
Okay, so now you're gonna put your left leg over.
- Yep, that's right.
There you go.
- Okay.
Thanks.
["The Only Boy Awake" playing] Through your window By the water Can you see me? - What am I supposed to be seeing? - When the wind blows through Just a shadow over the moon.
Look, it's growing slowly.
- A shadow - Oh growing slowly Yeah, just little bit by little bit.
Look closely.
When your love grew, I was there, too Wait, I see it.
- I should have told you - I see it.
I'm the only boy awake now Gazing at the stars - I dive into the blue, and you - It's kind of scary.
- Is it? - Oh Oh, oh Huh.
Oh I never had to walk like this before I never had to hide away I don't really wanna talk like this No more Are we walking till the night Turns to day? [bell rings] I knew Oh Oh Morning, Astronomy Boy.
Better than Helmet, I guess.
I feel they work together.
[Hannah] Alex, maybe you think I'm being silly, like I get my titties in a twist over the tiniest things but you didn't walk that hall.
- [toilet flushes] - [girls giggling] You didn't feel those eyes on you.
Come on.
You've never heard those whispers.
[bell rings] Ooh.
"Angie Romero, best lips!" You know it, baby! [giggles] [softly] Oh, my gosh, Hannah Baker? [giggles] Good morning, everybody.
I trust you all did the reading last night, so today we are going to jump into social learning theory.
So, the theory is that people learn by observing the behavior of those around them.
Can anybody give me an example of this? Anyone.
Clay.
Uh - Yeah, an example would be like slang.
- Mm-hmm.
If somebody starts saying some word, eventually everybody's saying it.
Very good.
So, one person's opinion or bias can influence the rest of the group.
This theory can also be applied to criminal behavior.
If a young person's friends or family participate in deviant acts, that young person is far more likely to do the same.
[Hannah] At first I thought, what a stupid list.
Jessica is so much prettier than me.
I didn't think of the chaos it would cause.
[Mrs.
Bradley] If one person in a social group begins to volunteer for a charity, they can influence their friends to do the same.
Hannah, I need your seat in a chair.
[laughter] [Hannah] But it was just a joke.
- Right, Alex? - Okay, let's focus up.
Continuing on, social media is now playing a big part You think I'm taking it all way too seriously.
connected 24/7.
Right? But here's the thing: You've never been a girl.
[sighs] It's good.
We just need to work on structure, and you use the word "unique," like, seven times.
If one thing is unique, the other six things should probably be, um - something else.
- What's wrong with unique? If something's unique, it means it's different, right? I'm saying this type of literature is different than other kinds of literature.
I mean, it is.
Isn't it, Jensen? Clay.
Ah.
You saw the list.
She does have Unique lips.
Yeah.
You should get her number.
- Don't want her number.
I'm just - Thinking about kissing her.
I am not.
Congrats, Angie.
Looking good.
Thank you, Jeffrey.
Shh! [whispers] Library.
Looking good, Clay.
Hey, Skye.
Sorry.
Oh, man.
Don't tell me you've got a thing for Twilight.
I don't.
I mean No, we just used to be friends.
Huh.
Cool.
She's a pretty girl.
I mean I don't know why she dresses like that.
But at least she's unique.
Mind if I join? No geometry homework? No, I did it last night.
My mom's prepping this trial, so she makes us do our homework together.
It's highly annoying, but I do admit it's cool to have homework done before the period before.
High school is bullshit.
Yeah.
Don't disagree.
But any specifics? I wish there was a button to fast-forward you through all the shitty parts in life straight to the good parts.
And where are the good parts? College.
In New York City.
Why New York? The minute I get there, I can be someone else.
Whoever I want to be.
But who you are now is okay.
Okay? High praise.
Thank you.
I mean, is awesome.
You're I mean, you made the hot list.
Seriously, Clay? What? They said you had the best That's out of a lot of good candidates.
Not that I've surveyed, I'm just saying.
What if girls made a list and you got worst biceps.
Girls would probably never do that list.
Precisely.
And my biceps are at least better than Alex's.
That kid hasn't lifted so much as a carton of milk in years, I think.
Once again, you and the point are complete strangers.
[whistle blows] Volley! Hey, uh, where were you going on Friday night when we passed? - [students clapping] - I was running some errands.
In Hannah's old neighborhood? - [whistle blows] - [applause] You guys got the best stores on your side of town.
Rich white folk.
We're not rich.
[whistle blows] - You're related to Angie Romero, right? - Yeah.
She's like my third cousin, maybe fourth.
Why doesn't she go here anymore? [Tony] She transferred to Catholic school.
Why? [whistle blows] I don't know.
Her dad is really strict and super Catholic.
Didn't have to do with her lips, did it? Her lips? - Oh, 'cause she was on the list? - [whistle blows] [Clay] Was that list a thing for her, like it was for Hannah? [Tony] I don't think so.
But Hannah Hannah got hurt.
It happens.
You never really know what's gonna hit how.
You don't know someone else's life.
You would know, right? - Heads up! - Ow! Son of a bitch! Jensen! Language! [whistle blows] What were you saying to Tony? Nothing, really.
Why? Mr.
Porter's asking questions.
Don't tell him anything.
And stop talking to Tony about it.
Tony's my friend.
No, not right now he's not.
[Zach] Yo, Standall.
Eating lunch with us later? I'm driving.
Uh Yeah, cool.
Meet me at Monet's after school, okay? [door opens] Alex! Alex Standall! Alex, what the hell! What were you thinking? Seriously! Come on.
Hannah, you know you can't be in here.
Why not? You've all been staring at my ass all day.
Hey.
Hey! Get out.
It's the boys' locker room.
We're not done.
[clamoring] Yeah, boy! Hannah Baker.
You hittin' that now? Aren't you with Jessica? Uh, no, not anymore.
'Cause Jessica's a good girl, right? But Hannah Baker puts out.
Yeah, man, just be careful.
Hannah's a crazy bitch! As Justin knows.
Man, how is little Alex getting more than all us? Uh, speak for yourself, big guy.
I get all I need.
Come on.
Let's go watch the girls warm up.
You coming, Standall? - Or are you too hot for us now? - [scoffs] [playing mellow tune] - Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys! - [music stops] Watch the downbeats.
Yeah? Yeah? I know you can count.
Schools in this town are not that bad.
Okay.
Back to 15.
One, two [band playing] Stop, stop, stop.
That little bump there.
Alex, tempo.
Fifteen, here we go.
One, two [band playing] No rushing, Alex I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but I need you to focus.
It's gotta be on point for the concert.
Fifteen, here we go.
You got this.
Just breathe.
Leave me alone.
One, two [band playing] Oh, there he is.
Yes, Alex! Love it! Go! [Jessica] Trust me, it will be fun.
So this contest is tomorrow? Yeah, but you actually have to be there to win.
I will.
- I promise.
- You promised before.
There's just a lot of shit going on at home, okay? Seth is back, so it's just easier for me to stay at Bryce's, that's all.
- [growls] - [chuckles] Am I supposed to be scared? Should I be, Justin? Scared.
Never.
There's nothing to be scared of.
- Justin! - Uh, hey, Coach.
Missed you at the pep rally.
And at practice.
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.
I've just had this stomach virus.
Yeah, we just got his medicine.
Mm-hmm.
Everything all right at home? Yes, sir, I've just been sick.
I'll be there tomorrow.
I won't let you down.
I'm not worried about you letting me down, son.
Colleges look at things like school attendance, game attendance, your grades.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Now you take that medicine.
And, son get yourself some eye drops while you're at it.
Oh.
Hey.
You work here now? You drink coffee now? Yeah.
I mean, I just sort of started.
Look at our little Clay, all grown up.
So, do you want one now? Oh, right.
Uh A small drip, please.
Black.
QuÃ© macho.
Is that a lizard on your neck? It's an alligator.
How many do you have now? Tattoos.
Why? Do you want to give your opinion? Everyone else feels entitled to.
No, I just I just wondered.
I like the alligator.
Remember that story I used to tell about my parents every time we drove over a bridge? I remember.
No, wait, I forgot.
When I was little, I used to cry every time we drove over a bridge.
I don't know why.
My mom used to try to distract me And she would tell you to look for a purple alligator in the water, and you'd be so busy looking you'd forget you were scared.
Yeah, that's the story.
It's on the house.
Oh.
[door opens] [Mr.
Porter] Do you think it might have been Clay who tore the posters down? I don't think so.
Clay and I are pretty close.
It's just not something he would do.
[Mr.
Porter] Hmm.
Can you think of anyone else who might have wanted to act out like that, about suicide or Hannah Baker's suicide? I can't think of anyone in particular.
No, I I know it's hit a lot of kids hard.
You two were friends with Hannah? Well, "friends" is I had a couple of classes with her.
No, but she wasn't involved in much, student council or anything, so [Mr.
Porter] Hm.
Did she ever talk about how she was feeling? Most of the time she seemed pretty chill to me.
I guess there were times she was emotional.
But who isn't? [Mr.
Porter] Yeah, that's true.
I'm just trying to look out for the kids who got hit extra hard by this.
I spoke with Alex Standall today.
How many espressos are in there? A lot.
I just started drinking coffee.
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.
I get anxiety.
Yeah, me too.
So, did you do it? I mean, did you put Hannah and Jessica on that list? You didn't know that? But you saw it.
Yeah, but I didn't, like, trace the handwriting.
I didn't think it was that big a deal.
Do you think she's right? Does everything that happened to her go back to you and that list? Well, I think it all started the night of Jessica's party.
What did she say about Jessica's party? Does she mention me there? Where are you in the tapes? I'm almost through yours.
Holy shit, Clay.
I mean I listened to 'em all in one night the first time.
You listened more than once? I listened to 'em twice.
Thought maybe I'd dreamed the whole thing.
Wait, so you haven't heard your own tape? No.
I can only listen in bits and pieces, or I I freak out.
I feel a panic attack coming on.
Aren't you desperate to hear yours, though? I'm afraid to.
Well, you should be.
But I mean, seriously, it was just a list.
Like, a stupid high school thing.
That fucking list.
I wish I never touched that fucking list.
Why did you? I don't know.
Bryce started it.
All the guys were working on it at lunch.
Why are you even friends with those guys? Justin, Zach, Bryce.
No, see, I'm not friends with Bryce.
But the other guys, Zach and I got to be friends last year, and he's always hanging around Justin.
They thought it was funny and stuff.
My dad was relieved that I had male friends.
Also, didn't totally suck at school that Justin Foley liked me back then.
Okay, back then.
Why are you friends now? Because if I stop hanging out, they're gonna know something's up.
I shouldn't even be talking to you.
- Seriously? - Yes.
But you don't even deserve to be on there.
I mean, you meant it as a compliment.
No.
No.
I meant it to piss Jessica off.
Because she wouldn't have sex with me.
Alex.
Don't.
That doesn't seem like you.
Yeah, it doesn't, does it? But it was.
And the guys already thought that we were, and I wanted to.
You know? I-I loved her.
And it did piss Jessica off, but not at me.
At Hannah.
Alex did this on his own.
He just broke up with me on his own.
Enjoy it.
'Cause you will, won't you? 'Cause that's what sluts do.
Fuck you.
[Alex] So not only did everyone think Hannah gave it up for me I took away her best friend.
And who knows? If she had a friend, maybe It's okay, man.
No, it's not.
It's not okay.
You want it to be okay because then you get off the hook, but you're losing your shit.
You want to think whatever you did couldn't be why Hannah killed herself.
But the truth is that I did, I killed Hannah Baker! And Justin killed Hannah Baker.
And Jessica.
And you.
We all killed Hannah Baker.
Maybe you need some chamomile tea.
'Cause people are listening? Well, it's too bad no one paid attention before.
[door opens] - What is that about? - I told you.
He's not your friend.
He's not even on the tapes.
Tony, he's in this for Tony.
Alex.
Alex! [door opens] Who's that? He's just a friend.
His name is Clay.
Was he friends with Hannah? I'm not sure how close they were.
[Hannah] You want evidence, Alex? You want storm clouds and thunder? Let's go to E-3 on your maps, everyone.
The Blue Spot liquor store where butterfly met hurricane.
The Blue Spot was a block and a half away from my first house here.
Hey, Wally.
Oh, hey.
And I went there whenever I desperately needed chocolate, which was, like, most days of the week.
Why do you even sell candy bars that don't have nuts in them? 'Cause some people don't like nuts.
And some people are allergic.
Some people are tragic.
- What's up, Wally? - What's up? So, I see you went for nuts again.
That's how you talk to a lady, Wally? I got the candy.
Your parents own Baker Drugs, right? But you buy candy here? Um, better selection.
And fewer moms counting my calorie intake.
There you go.
- Did you just? - Oh, no, I didn't mean It's just It's real tight.
In the store.
It's tight in the store.
I don't usually listen to sophomore gossip, but, um for what it's worth, that list got it right.
[Hannah] It seems like nothing.
Until the hurricane hits.
Because when you put my name on that list, you put a target on my well, it wasn't just my ass.
You made it open season on Hannah Baker.
Hi, are are you Wally? No.
Wally's off.
What's up, my man? Hey, how you doin', Bryce? What's up, Jensen? Uh, hey, Bryce.
You live around here? Um, no.
A friend told me about it.
Yeah, me too.
It's an easy card.
You looking for a cold one? Tough day? No, I just I came to grab some sugary carbonated matter.
Stuff's not good for you, man.
What you need's something all-natural.
Malt liquor.
Made from barley.
Um, I don't have I.
D.
Stand on your tippy-toes.
Look old.
I.
D.
? Uh, I must have left it at home, or at my high school.
I got both.
- You don't have to - Sure I do.
You're welcome.
Keep it.
Thank you, sir.
- There he is! Jensen! - [shouting] Come drink with us, buddy! I, uh Thanks, but I gotta get home for dinner.
Oh, that's cute.
Come on.
You come all the way out to Blue Spot.
You let Bryce-y buy you a beer.
No, I really gotta No, the least you can do is drink with us.
Come on.
Drink your 40.
Alex, you're up, man! Oh, yes, I love it, I love it.
Freak versus geek! Time trial.
Forty ounces.
Let's do it.
Don't you have a concert? I did, yeah, but actually, I quit jazz band.
- It's just pointless.
- [engine revs] [chatter] [Bryce] Oh, look! Your boyfriend's waiting for you.
The record is 18 seconds.
Whassup! - Wait, to drink it all? - Yes.
To drink it all.
There's two ways you leave, Jensen: buzzed or beat down.
Come on, Jensen, don't be a bitch! [laughs] All right, here we go.
You ready? Five, four, three, two, one! - [all shouting, laughing] - Go, go, go, go! ["Cowards Starve" playing] You got it! Come on, you got it! Go, go! Come on, Jensen! No turning back! Let's go! Come on, keep going! Go, go, go, go! It's so fucking close! Go, go! So close! Oh, my God, Jensen! Attaboy! What the fuck! Okay, all right.
That was pretty good.
What the fuck was that? - This tastes like shit.
- Fuckin' finish it anyway.
Are you fucking shitting me? [car horn honks] Hey, really appreciate your help.
Looked like you were having a good time.
Why are you following me? I wasn't.
I saw you with Alex.
I thought you were on his tape.
Why were you with Mrs.
Baker earlier? Look, if you can't trust me, I can't help you.
Tony.
- What the hell? - [engine starts] - Tony! - [tires screech] ["Cowards Starve" continues] I'm gonna show them That the field of bones Will never never never Never be joined, right! Wide-eyed sleeper I'm gonna drown them in the breakers Uh-huh, I'm gonna tear That mountain down I'm gonna turn it out And go out in style Cowards starve Like a weed sick man In the throes of a bummer Social pressures exist And if you think about them All of the time You're gonna find that Your head's been kicked in You're gonna do it all For the grind - [grunting] - Get him! Get in there, man, get in there! Come on! [song fades] [video game sound effects] Who gets drunk off of one fucking beer? [Zach] Well, you can if it's a 40.
And if you chug it.
And if you're that small.
And if you're a fucking pussy.
Okay, yeah, maybe he's a pussy, but he can make a fuckload of trouble for us right now.
Especially if he starts talking to Bryce.
He's not gonna talk to Bryce.
He's not gonna talk to anybody.
And he can't hide behind Tony forever.
Sooner or later, we're gonna bring him out into the open and shut him down.
[door shuts] - [Clay] Hey.
- Here he is.
Sorry I'm late.
I got a little distracted on my way home.
Said you'd be here half an hour ago.
Where were you? Uh I was with a friend.
She was in trouble, and I I didn't believe her, so I checked it out and it was true.
She was telling the truth.
Are you drunk? I think so.
Wow, this is escalating fast.
You've never done anything like this before.
Drinking on a school night? Riding your bike while drunk? I'm sorry about that.
How much did you drink, son? Just one beer.
It was a big beer, though, and it was disgusting.
All right, enough.
You are grounded.
For two weeks, you will go straight to school and come straight home afterwards, no activities, no hanging out with friends.
Okay, before we get to the sentencing phase, let's all just sit down to dinner.
You need some food and water in you, and then we can talk about No, I don't, actually.
I'm not that hungry.
Um, I think I'm just gonna go to my room I'm sorry.
[Bryce] You fight like a little girl.
Come on, Foley.
[taunting] Foley! Come on! Oh, fuck.
Get him! Come on, Justin, you fight like a girl! Is that your arm, or are you excited to see me? Fuck you! You fight like a fuckin' bitch! Little fuckin' bitch.
Fuck you.
I'm not your fuckin' bitch, bitch.
[Bryce laughing] Ow! Come on, Alex, play or don't.
We're getting killed! Fuck you, Montgomery.
[Zach] Oh! [Zach laughing] - Dude, you team-killed me! - Yeah, I did.
Dude, you're a really good shot.
Yeah, I am.
["Into the Black" playing] I'll shoot in his spot.
[grunting] Oh, fuck.
[Hannah] The butterfly effect.
It started with Justin, then on to you, Alex.
And the rest of you.
Maybe these tapes will start a new butterfly effect.
Who knows? Everything affects everything.
My, my Hey, hey Rock'n roll is here to stay It's better to burn out Than to fade away My, my Hey, hey Out of the blue and into the black I give you this But you pay for that And once you're gone You can never come back When you're out of the blue Into the black [song fades] [Hannah] Shh.
For this next one, you need to be very, very quiet.
Because you're about to do something very wrong.
Be careful.
And don't get caught.
[dramatic rock music] 

1 Shh.
For this next one, you need to be very, very quiet.
Because you're about to do something very wrong.
Be careful.
And don't get caught.
Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to watch someone? To invade someone's privacy? Do you wonder what secrets you might uncover? What skeletons you might turn up? Well, for this next one, you're about to find out.
A-4 on your map, kids.
Mother Now, don't say you're too afraid or that you don't feel comfortable doing this kind of thing, because guess what? You spy on people every day.
We're always watching someone.
Following someone.
And being followed.
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram they've made us a society of stalkers.
And we love it.
Of course, stalking someone in real life is a whole 'nother thing.
That's right.
I had a stalker.
And if you've made it to A-4, you're outside his window.
Just like I am right now.
Any guesses yet? No? Well, stay tuned to hear about the skeletons he dug up.
For now let's see if he's got any of his own.
I get that it's a thrill looking into someone's life.
My heart's pounding right now.
Can you hear it? Listen.
Marcus! You asshole.
What the hell? - What are you doing? - Sorry, okay? I said your name, like, three times.
What are you wearing? Oh, I totally forgot.
I'm El NiÃ±o.
The tropical storm? No? Okay.
Wow, I really hope you're not one of the judges tomorrow, 'cause Marcus, what are you doing? The costume contest.
Two hundred bucks.
Here what are you doing out here? Oh.
I heard you, man.
The car alarm.
I live right over there.
Besides, you're not the first one to come look at the famous window.
We all did it.
And we all took our shot.
Wait, "we"? Are you on the? Why? What did you do? Who knows? Okay? I didn't listen.
I just started each tape till I heard who it was, figured out who came after me, and passed 'em on.
But what about the second set? - Hannah said that if we don't listen - Hannah said.
Dude, Hannah's dead.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
Nothing anyone did to her was any different than what happens to every girl at every high school.
She just wanted attention.
And leaving those tapes that's a fucked-up thing to do! No one deserves that.
Except maybe that psycho.
Tyler Down? Dude, listen, take your shot and pass those things on, man.
You'll feel better.
We need to get this window fixed, Tyler.
It's time.
They're just gonna break it again.
Who are these kids? We need names.
I want to report it to the school or to the police.
No.
We don't need to.
Just forget it.
I don't know who they are, Dad, okay? Why are they doing this? I said I don't know, okay? Can I just do my homework, please? Yeah.
Welcome to your tape, Tyler Down.
Good night.
So, tell me when did it start? How long were you watching me, Tyler? I can't believe you don't like them.
Look, I'm just saying, I don't Okay, vampires, aliens, even werewolves, I get it.
I get the motivation, I get the metaphors, right? But, like, zombies? They're just They're just stupid.
So you hate zombies? You're a zombie racist.
Just, like, I don't understand 'em.
What's their story? They don't want to take over the world, kill their masters, anything interesting.
They're not good or evil.
They're just hungry for brains.
I mean, like, brains.
Well thank you for walking me home.
And for destroying all future zombie media for me forever.
Anytime.
Asshole.
Turn around, dude.
I didn't really think anything of it at first.
Must have been the sound of a tree branch in the wind.
But the sound followed me.
I was too scared to move even to shut the blinds.
These pictures are proof.
They're gonna help us in the fight.
And if we tear this room apart I don't want to tear this room apart, and I'm not sure I want to fight.
We have to.
For Hannah.
What about for us? Honey, our daughter is gone.
Christ, Andy, I know that! I have to know why.
I need to know why.
And if you don't, I I didn't sleep much that night.
You should know.
But then, the pictures you took that night aren't the reason you're on this tape, are they? We're talking about one picture in particular.
Goddamn it, Tyler.
How bad is it? Oh, um Hey, Dad.
How bad is what? I'll never forget my first hangover.
Uh Yeah.
First.
Is that what I'm feeling? Ugh.
I prefer to leave my lectures in the lecture hall, but, you know there's actually an important lesson to be learned from a hangover.
Don't drink? Sure, but you'll drink.
It happens.
The overarching lesson is that actions have consequences.
Judging from the way you look, you've probably suffered enough for today.
What is that? Hot sauce, horseradish, kale, a raw egg, and, uh, about six other things designed to cure a hangover.
Oh, no, don't smell it.
Just drink.
So, listen, uh, I talked to Mom about the grounding situation and all it entails, and I managed to convince her to stay her ruling, on one condition: You gotta start opening up to us, kid.
Just you know, let us know what's going on.
Only enough to keep us informed.
And your mother also prefers no more closed doors.
Literal and figurative.
Oh, and no big spread this morning.
It's just us, so cereal okay? Wait, where's Mom? So, mood swings.
Refusal to participate in group activities, change in their appearance You're making me feel like a bad student.
I'm starting to feel like a bad parent.
declining GPA and substance abuse.
Now, paying close attention to these warning signs can help you prevent your children from making a terrible mistake.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr.
Porter, for that informative presentation.
If anybody has questions, we're happy to answer now.
Yeah? What can you tell us about this lawsuit? Was that girl bullied? Actually, legally, we are not allowed to discuss that, but we can all become more involved in our children's lives, okay? And that starts at home.
Yeah? Should we be worried about our own kids being bullied? In our experience, relative to many other schools, we do not have a problem with bullying.
Then why did that girl do it? That girl's name is Hannah.
Mrs.
Baker.
It's so good to see you.
We didn't know you'd be joining us.
Well, I'm still a member of the school community, right? And if you want to know why I suggest you ask your own children.
Or take a look at the walls of the restrooms they use every day.
"Bitch.
" "Slut.
" "Whore.
" "Die.
" Die! These are the words carved on the walls of the bathrooms they use, and your kids did the carving.
Tyler.
Wait, hey, Tyler.
Tyler.
Hey.
I'm sorry, man.
This fucking chain is gay.
You look really hot.
- I look like a punk rock dog.
- Mmm-hmm.
What? Justin, what? You said you wanted to do this.
I do.
I'm here, right? I'm doing it.
What the fuck are you looking at, Jensen? He's checking out our awesome costumes.
Clay gets it, right? Yeah.
Sid Vicious, born John Ritchie, bassist for the Sex Pistols, and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen.
Nice.
But you know how the story ends, right? What? How does the story end? Thanks, Clay.
How does the story end? I don't know.
I think you kill me.
Alex, hey.
Alex! Hey.
Have you seen Tyler? Why? I did research about what he did.
- I think that we should - No, see, there's no "we," okay? You should be very careful about who you talk to.
There he is! Jensen! Nice work last night, buddy.
You can hold your booze.
Yeah, I bet he puked like a bitch.
Fuck you, Dempsey.
You puked on three wine coolers last weekend.
Yeah, because they were strawberry.
I'm allergic.
I'm having a Halloween thing at my place, super small.
You should come.
Alex will be there.
I uh, I'll think about it.
What, you got something else to do? How about French? Madame Steinberg? You needed help with the homework.
Why would I need your help I mean, yeah, sure.
Whatever.
Think about it, Jensen.
I have a better grade than you in French.
I was just trying to help.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
Where was your help last night? Where'd you go? I had a family thing.
- Family thing? - Yeah.
That's good.
"Megan is a whore and a" what on earth is a "cum dumpster"? Well, sir, I assume well, it could be a guy or a girl, actually.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
These kids, they can't even spell, and they come up with this shit.
How have we never seen this before? Oh, well, faculty is not supposed to be in the students' restroom.
I could call the janitorial staff and see if they could repaint these walls.
Well, I think we should, although I don't know how this is going to calm Olivia Baker at all.
Yeah.
I'm wondering if her husband is any more reasonable.
I actually know Andy a bit.
I shop at their store.
I understand about the grief, all right? It's just the It's the grasping for blame.
It's just graffiti, right? Oh, my God! In honor of Halloween, your in-class essay today will analyze this quote from chapter four of Beyond Good and Evil: "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that he does not become a monster.
" Psst.
I'm worried about you, Clay.
Why aren't you entering the costume contest? Because I'm not wearing a costume.
Can you think of the abyss in your own life? Can you think of an occasion in the book where the protagonist lost their way? - What monsters have you - Psst.
You're gonna get in trouble.
Watch and learn.
- You sleep in class? - Are you kidding? With my schedule, power naps are essential.
I just couldn't sleep last night.
Obsessing over the history exam? Uh, no.
About who you're going to take to Winter Formal? People take people to that? Quiet study, please.
What else has you up nights? I think there's someone outside my window.
What, like a burglar? Like someone taking pictures.
No way! Shh.
Nothing that interesting ever happens to me.
I'm not sure "interesting" is the first word that comes to mind.
It's sort of awful.
You have to do something about it.
Like what? I don't know.
But I'll help.
Girls.
I didn't realize you were taking photography.
Yep, the project is all about contrast, which is why we have to do it at night, and which is why I have to sleep over.
- It's due tomorrow.
- I see.
I would like your parents' number, just in case.
Already put the Bakers in your contacts.
You'll make sure to text me before you go to bed? Yes.
And you're sure you don't want me to help I've got it, Dad, really.
Okay, okay.
He's very involved.
That's the worst, right? No, it's cool.
I like that you can just talk to him.
I wish I could do that.
Grass is always greener, I guess.
That was the first time I've ever lied to either of them.
Welcome to the dark side.
Technically, it's for bears.
Supposedly, like, blinds the bears, giving you time to run away.
So, who do you think it could be? I don't know, but there's this creepy old dude on the corner who walks with an umbrella on perfectly sunny days.
- Weird.
- Exactly.
My money's on him.
He's gonna need more than an umbrella to block the rays of this thing.
Wanna see? You may want to look away.
I'm amazed you still shoot on film.
I shoot all different ways, but film really makes you focus on the image you're creating.
It's not just there for you on a screen.
These are really good.
Yeah.
I need you to print a few for the tribute issue.
- Okay.
- Can you get them in time? Yeah, I'm already started.
That one.
That one.
This candid.
Wow.
This one.
You really did capture her, didn't you? Um I've really got a lot of work to do.
Do you think you could? - Yeah.
- Yeah, okay, cool.
Yeah, no, um You've got a real eye.
Jesus, Clay, what are you doing in here? Just seeing what our prize-winning photographer is working on.
Interesting stuff.
Well, no, don't.
This is all for yearbook only.
You're not supposed to be here.
Really? You're gonna call me out on trespassing? I heard your tape.
And throwing a rock through my window isn't enough? I didn't throw one.
So, what do you want, then? I want you to delete the photos you took.
Destroy the negatives.
Whatever.
- Or I'm turning you in.
- Turning me in? What, are you gonna turn everybody in? Like Justin and Alex? You stalked her.
I'm the student life photographer, okay? I stalk everybody.
It's my job.
That means you stand outside everyone's windows? - No, it doesn't mean that.
- That's a relief.
'Cause a first-time offense is only six months in jail, but for repeat offenders, that's a year.
That's not a thing.
Criminal invasion of a minor's privacy.
Look it up.
I don't think they'll let you have a camera in prison, but maybe you can draw pictures.
- I'm not a criminal.
- You are.
- And you're a creep.
- I just took pictures.
- You humiliated her.
- I didn't mean to.
- You ruined her.
- I loved her! And I know I barely knew her, but I I saw her.
Most people, you put a camera on them, and they smile.
They pose.
They basically fake it.
You don't see them, you see their mask.
Whenever my camera was on Hannah, she was different.
Like, real, and I fell in love with that.
Real.
So, yeah, I took pictures of her, but that's because girls like that don't hang out with the yearbook guy, with me.
Why didn't you just talk to her? Why didn't you? What do you mean? Come on, I stalk everybody, remember? I don't miss much.
You loved her, too.
And all you did was watch her from the sidelines, so I guess we're not so different, are we? Delete the pictures, Tyler.
Destroy them.
All of them.
Come on.
You sure you don't want to keep just one? Okay, everybody.
Drumroll, please.
Tight race, you guys, but I think we've narrowed down our finalists.
We're gonna choose the winner by applause.
The costume with the most applause takes home 200 smackers, so Genius is so often misunderstood.
Mud divers! Hey, you okay? Yeah.
You kept listening, didn't you? I know that feeling, man.
Hurts bad, I know it.
Let yourself off the hook.
Hannah's gone.
And it's terrible, but we've got to live on.
And let go.
Come hang out with everybody tonight.
Bring the tapes.
We'll figure it out.
Okay, okay, okay.
Ladies and gents, I think we have a winner! Justin and Jessica, as sexy punk rockers! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Sid and Nancy, for fuck's sake.
Come on! Whoo! Pathetic, right? - What? - The way they celebrate themselves and just their whole group.
It's It's better to stay outside of it all.
You know? No, I don't know.
Seriously? You're following me into the bathroom now? Silent treatment.
Wow.
You know what? Good.
'Cause I'm tired of it all anyway.
- Clay.
- Oh, it speaks! Clay, those guys are using you.
They just want to shut you down.
And whatever they're offering you, they're lying.
You lied to me.
You lied about where you were last night.
I saw you.
With your brothers.
I saw you beating up that guy.
Or were you just "helping" him too? Clay.
Clay! Oh, fuck.
- Still open? - Still open.
Oh, thank God.
My wife would kill me if I came home empty-handed again.
Okay.
You got uh, two different sizes here.
I got two different kids, two and a half and nine months.
I'm running on fumes here.
I think I slept a few hours last week.
I remember those times.
Oh! We ran out of these last year.
You know, I fought having the Walplex move in, too.
I mean, maybe it's open late, but it's not this, you know? It's not people we know.
Well, thank you.
We appreciate your business.
'Course, if I've learned anything from watching high school football, the bigger team always seems to win.
Am I right? Um Look, I know this whole lawsuit thing has made it hard to talk to people, but if you ever needed someone to talk to Not me, of course.
That would be Um I could recommend someone.
You know, a professional.
Yeah, thank you, that's a very kind offer, but, uh I think we're handling it our own way.
Don't forget your keys.
Good luck with your store.
Come on! Hey, hey, whoa, whoa! What are you guys doing? Let's go, let's go! Get out of here.
Drop it, right now! You stay right there while I call the police.
- Wait, this wasn't me.
- It's in your hand.
No, I was taking it down.
Really.
Mrs.
Baker, I knew Hannah.
We used to work together.
I was riding by, and I saw these kids You knew Hannah? I did.
Would you want to come inside? Sure.
Bye.
We won't be late.
I don't know.
Maybe we should just change the reservations to another night.
They'll be fine.
I think this place will probably charge the card if we move it.
Wow.
You said you wanted a nice restaurant.
Um, what are you guys still doing here? Your mother thinks that we should stay home.
And break date night? You guys, go.
Do, yeah, date night things I'm trying not to picture right now.
- The only thing - We've got pizza money.
I'm just thinking maybe I should cook dinner for your new friend.
She's gonna be my new ex-friend if you guys don't stop acting weird.
- Okay.
- Okay.
All right, have fun.
Thank you.
- I love you.
- Okay, bye.
Alone at last.
Shall we? Okay, so Once it's dark and we hear him outside the window We open the window and flash the light.
Mm-hmm.
And expose creepy umbrella guy.
Aah! Oh, my God, don't say "expose.
" What if he's? Eww.
Eww.
Okay.
For the first time, I'm freaking.
Me too.
Do we need courage? I could use some courage.
My husband was the one who suggested that we not give out candy this year.
He thought seeing all the kids would make me too emotional.
Now all it's done is attract them.
I'm really sorry.
Kids can be Yes.
They can.
Did you Did you want a soda or something? I'm really fine, thank you.
Hannah didn't have many friends, so I'm I'm thrilled to finally meet one.
Clay, was it? Yes.
Clay Jensen.
You do look familiar, though.
You two worked together? Right.
At the Crestmont.
I wonder if she said anything to you.
Did she ever talk to you about her experiences at school? Uh, experiences? I mean, did she ever say anything to you that would indicate that she might have been mistreated or bullied in any way? I, uh we didn't really talk about that kind of thing, I guess.
Maybe I was more of, um an acquaintance than a close friend.
I see.
We moved to this town for a fresh start.
For all of us, but especially for Hannah.
You just ask yourself over and over what happened? Todd.
Hi.
Andy! Hey! I, uh, wow, I guess you got curious too, about all this Walplex nonsense.
Sure.
Listen, Dr.
Mendez hasn't called in your refill.
It's been a couple of months.
Should I give him a ring? Uh, no, I'm No, there's no need.
Okay, well Take care.
Give my best to Olivia, please.
Thank you for this.
Now I know who's responsible.
You are! You killed Hannah! Who does that? Who? The whole thing.
Like Wait.
Shut up, wait.
So the whole Justin thing was just a rumor? I totally thought you guys went to third.
Nope.
Just first.
Also, why someone picked the most boring sport ever to mark our sexual milestones still kind of baffles me.
My God.
I am so sorry.
I totally misjudged you.
It's cool.
I misjudge me all the time.
Boys are assholes.
Sometimes I think we'd be better off without them.
I will drink to that.
What is in this? Vodka, Scotch, KahlÃºa, and and just enough of anything the parents won't notice is missing! It's kind of like when you run your soda cup under the fountain drinks at the Crestmont, just, you know, with liquor.
Yeah, my friend Kat and I used to call it a suicide.
I can't imagine why.
So, yeah, we kind of lost track of the plan.
Okay.
Your turn.
I dare you to take another drink.
But it was so nice having a new friend.
Boring! Well, I don't know.
Okay, your turn.
I dare you to take off your bra.
Under your shirt.
Relax.
Okay.
I dare you to take off your shirt.
Um I dare you to kiss me.
Yeah, right.
- Seriously? - Come on.
Doesn't mean anything.
Come on.
Here, I'll close my eyes.
Everything okay? Sorry, I just got turned around on my way back from This is Hannah's room? Yes.
It is.
But you knew that already.
I what? I knew you looked familiar.
I saw you standing outside that window.
I was just, uh No, it's okay.
I'm not angry.
But, um Maybe we could help each other.
You must have questions.
It's actually It's getting late, Mrs.
Baker.
No, no, no.
Please, Clay.
I'm just trying to piece things together.
You don't need My parents are expecting me home.
No, we We never got a note.
We never got a reason.
So now my daughter might as well be an acquaintance to me, too.
I have some of her things, some of her photos, and, um, her notes.
We could look at them together.
Wait wait here? It's hard to say exactly how things turned, but let's just say that night, things escalated quickly.
While Courtney didn't hear my stalker arrive I did.
Thankfully, I found a way to kill two birds with one stone.
Wait.
Who are you? Tyler? Tyler Down? Oh, my God, you said it was some creepy guy from down the street! I thought it was.
Uh, I should - Wait.
- I should go.
What? No.
Courtney.
Courtney, wait.
Come back.
Wait.
Please, I just want to talk.
I'm sorry, my mom's waiting for me.
I'm sorry.
Remember when I said you wouldn't believe the skeletons Tyler found? Turns out they weren't mine.
Hey.
They were Courtney's.
- Everything okay? - Everything's great.
Um, I'm sorry I left last night.
I just wasn't feeling well.
Okay.
Should we at least talk about it? There's nothing to talk about.
Okay.
Listen, I'm going to get those pictures from Tyler, so don't worry about that.
Yeah, okay.
Good.
Good.
You should.
Is this all of them? Yeah.
Um, Hannah, wait.
Um Would you ever want to hang out? You want to hang out with me? I guess we all have secrets.
And nobody likes it when their secret gets out.
What did you do? Whoa, what's wrong? No, I talked to Tyler this morning.
- He told me he got rid of all of them.
- Well, he lied.
Group-texted half the school.
Okay, look, calm down.
No one can tell that's us.
You don't think they'll figure it out? I shouldn't even be seen talking to you right now.
- Because of a stupid picture? - Come on, Hannah.
You of all people should know what a picture can do to a person's life.
Me of all people? I told you Just stay away from me, okay? Courtney.
Funny thing is, no one ever found out it was us.
That whole fall, everyone looked at that picture.
I'd imagine some boys more than once.
But no one ever knew who it was.
Well, now you know.
So, just, a gentle reminder about closed doors.
Sorry.
Old habits.
I'll work on it.
Your mother has dinner ready.
And a special surprise.
Yeah.
Be right down.
Like I said, we're a society of stalkers.
We're all guilty.
We all look.
We all think things we're ashamed of.
The only difference is, Tyler you got caught.
Guys, I have to go out after dinner, okay? Won't be long.
Where you going? What are you doing here? Your mom invited me.
There you are! I ran into Tony's dad at school today.
I haven't seen Tony in so long, I thought, invite him to dinner.
You have three older brothers? God, I only had one, and we fought constantly.
Though, to be fair, he's an asshole.
Matt! Well, we actually get along pretty well.
Really? I feel I saw you guys fighting recently.
Well, that's true.
We're not afraid of confrontation, but at the end of the day, we always know whose side we're on.
How's that history project going? With the cassettes.
That's a good question.
How are things going, Clay? I, uh I think I'm done, actually.
Oh, yeah? - Already? - Yeah.
I think I'm just gonna pass the project on to the next student.
Sounds very collaborative.
A colleague of mine is studying collaborative learning theory.
It actually strengthens your synapses.
Wow.
Um Yeah, it's - It's like our oral history is - Trick or treat! passed down through the generations.
That kind of thing.
Fantastic.
It's the oral tradition.
Except if we don't finish our part first, we could fail the whole assignment.
Right? We could.
But I doubt it.
I would hate for us to have to face those repercussions.
Maybe we won't.
Maybe those repercussions aren't even real.
As your project partner, I would highly recommend that we Are you my partner? The assignment was very clear what would happen if we broke the rules.
The assignment was given by a dead person.
In history.
The historical figure is dead, obviously.
Sure, sure.
In a sense, all our assignments are given by dead people.
Hmm? I mean, we came here to get away from the fucking Walplexes and and now, they've not only followed us, but but they're stealing our customers.
Walplex isn't the reason why people aren't coming in, Andy.
They're scared of us.
They can't face us.
What can we do about that? We could fight.
You know, take on the monolith.
We've got those pictures from the bathroom that you took.
We have that list.
And if that's not enough, we're just gonna have to find something else, because we have to let them know this is not a senseless tragedy, that there are reasons why this happened.
That our little girl has a face.
And a name.
Okay.
Okay.
That guy you saw last night.
He messed with my sister.
Me and my brothers took care of it.
Messed with You should call the police.
The police in my neighborhood are a little different than yours.
Sometimes when there's no justice, you make it for yourself.
Don't go to Bryce's.
Don't listen to Marcus.
Just don't do it.
Why not? It's not what Hannah wanted.
How do you know what Hannah wanted? Hey, how do you even Marcus told me he just passed the tapes on.
- Marcus lied.
- How do you know? There probably isn't even a second set of tapes.
It's probably all bullshit.
Hey, it's Hannah.
Hannah Baker.
That's right.
Don't adjust your whatever device you're hearing this on.
It's me, live and in stereo.
Thing is even though Tyler stopped coming around I never stopped feeling afraid.
So what could I do after that? First the school, then my house even my own bedroom.
Nowhere was safe.
You took all that away.
You guys have any idea how much shit I'm in with Jessica? - Where the fuck is he? - He'll be here.
If he doesn't show, we're done making friends.
We do it my way.
- What is your way, exactly? - We make him understand.
Yeah, understand what? Candy's in the bowl.
You got a delivery.
Holy shit, is that them? - The fuck! Those are for my dad! - Uh Dude! I must be, like, really stoned or something.
Okay, we should not be doing this at his house.
Really? Should we do it at yours? - He's going to find out.
- Maybe he should.
Maybe that's how this ends.
No.
This ends with Clay.
Whatever we have to do, okay? You're freaking me out.
Maybe you're too fucking stoned, huh? You made me paranoid, Tyler.
So now I'm giving that to you.
Maybe I'll never know why you did what you did.
But I can make you understand how it felt to be me.
That's why I'm outside your window, Tyler.
And after people hear this, I bet I won't be the only one.
Knock knock, Tyler.
Oh, shit.
Fucking Clay.
You're so done.
You're so fucking done.

1 [theme music playing] - ["The Night We Met" playing] - Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh I am not the only traveler [Hannah] Boys are assholes.
Who has not repaid his debt Some are assholes all of the time.
I've been searching For a trail to follow All are assholes some of the time.
- Take me back to the night we met - It's just how boys are.
Well - maybe not all boys.
- Ooh Ooh Hey, Jeff.
Go get her.
[Clay] Go get her and do what? It's a dance.
Dance with her.
I can't.
You know I can't dance.
Tonight, you can.
I promise.
Come on.
- You've got this.
- [sighs] I had all and then most of you Some and now none of you Take me back to the night we met Sir.
- Madam.
- [laughs] Will take me back to the night we met You've been taking lessons.
I've been watching Strictly Ballroom.
Midnight show.
I'm impressed.
I'm impressive.
Stick with me.
You'll see.
Can you do that? Stick with me? - I had all and then most of you - I can.
Some and now none of you - Clay.
- [song distorts, fading] [Clay] Oh, God.
Hey, Hannah.
Do something! What? What can I do? [clapping] Well done, Clay! [Hannah] Mostly, boys are assholes.
I'll help! But girls - girls can be evil.
- No! Oh, fuck.
Little light housekeeping? - Yeah, I was just going to do laundry.
- You were? I don't think I've ever seen you do laundry.
- I live to surprise you.
- Really? Oh, honey, did you have an accident? Did I? Jesus, Mom, no, I'm not seven.
I got hot last night.
I can take those.
- I can do my own laundry.
- In 17 years, I've had no evidence that's true.
I'm doing a load anyway.
Thank you.
Family breakfast in ten.
We're still attempting that? Attempting and achieving.
Good morning, pal.
Dad, we talked about "pal.
" Good morning, honey.
Well played.
[sniffs] Did you shower? I totally showered.
I feel it's possible you didn't shower.
I didn't shower.
Did you shower last night? Look, I just I turned the water on just now, and I thought about it all, the whole thing, taking clothes off, dealing with hair, and I just I couldn't do it.
Look, we shower, like every day, and it's just a lot.
Okay.
Clay, honey I need to discuss something with you.
Oh, shit, I gotta go.
I'm meeting someone at Monet's for a school project.
Love you guys.
[door closes] Okay.
It's possible there's something going on with him.
Can I have a triple Americano to go, please? My name is Clay.
C-L-A-Y.
Thank you, Theresa.
[Hannah] Courtney Crimsen.
What a pretty name.
And what a pretty girl.
With her perfect family.
Coffee together, every morning.
Your opening paragraph is so strong.
I love the parallel you make between Snowball in Animal Farm and Hosni Mubarak.
Thanks, Dad.
But here's the thing then you get more general.
You just need more specifics.
Got it.
Yeah, you're right.
[Hannah] And you're also very nice, Courtney.
Everyone says so.
You're really blowing up this morning, sweetheart.
Social or school? Uh, it's a big test.
You know, everyone's freaking out about it.
It's the usual.
You're nice to everyone all the time.
Um I should go.
I have to stop by the florist on the way to school, for Hannah's memorial.
Oh, hey, don't forget dinner tonight with the Simonsons.
Bring a friend from school.
- Oh, maybe Marcus.
- I do love that Marcus.
He's a good one.
You'd make beautiful babies.
Dear God, honey, you cannot say that.
Why not? It's a hypothetical.
It is racist and it's sexist.
Marcus and I are just friends.
I should go.
See you tonight.
- Yeah.
Have a great day.
- Go kick ass.
All right.
Love you.
[Hannah] You're one of the most popular girls in school.
And you are just so nice.
Right? Wrong.
Tyler! Yo, Tyler! Hey, Ty-Ty! Nice ass, buddy! [cheering] [bell rings] What the hell, Clay? - That picture's all over school.
- Yeah.
That can happen, can't it? What are you trying to do? Anything.
I'm trying to do something, anything, which is more than any of you did.
Well, I'm the only one catching any shit for it, okay? Who the whole school's laughing at, the only one you've done something about.
So far.
You're the only one so far.
Thank you.
I didn't know Clay Jensen did dancing.
Clay Jensen lost a bet to Jeff Atkins.
[girls giggle] It's cute how Clay talks about himself in third person.
[Courtney] Here's your ticket, handsome.
Remember, it's formal, so no exposed midriffs.
- Got it.
- And I hope you'll save a dance for me.
Um Sure.
I don't actually dance.
Hey, Helmet! Oh, hey.
Are you going to this? Ooh.
Uh Don't think so.
Not really in a romantic winter dance place.
[Courtney] But you totally should be.
I mean, lots of cute guys bought tickets today.
Mm-hmm.
Besides, can't the best ass in the sophomore class find a date? [girls laughing] Ladies, please.
No objectifying comments, okay? We have to stick together.
Girl power, right? Well, Hannah, you should totally come.
There will be many single hot guys there.
Clay.
Well, she should go, right? Um Sure, yeah.
Yes.
I should, uh it's class and stuff.
[bell rings] [Jessica] I thought you said nothing's changed.
[Justin] Yeah, 'cause nothing has changed.
- Justin, don't.
- I'm not gonna do anything.
[Justin] Clay.
Clay! Jensen! Hey, Justin.
That's a pretty picture you took of Tyler.
Not as pretty as the one he took of Hannah.
You made your point.
Now shut it down.
"Shut it down"? Who talks like that? This is beyond just us now.
This is the whole school.
If we fall, you go down with us.
Maybe I don't care.
Maybe you should.
[phone chimes] Okay, look, calm down.
No one can tell that's us.
Oh, come on, Hannah.
You of all people should know what a picture can do to a person's life.
[Hannah] I hoped we could be friends, Courtney.
I needed a friend.
I think you did too.
Who do you think it is? Duh.
I don't think so.
I have gym with her, and she only wears sports bras.
Maybe I save my nice shit for after hours.
[class laughing] Damn, girl, you are slick! Listen, Laura, you ever want to swing the other way You'd be the last person I called.
Right before the police.
[laughing] [Hannah] But you had some secrets that you wanted to keep, even from yourself.
[teacher] Courtney.
Courtney! Sorry.
Um, can I I need to go to the office.
Hello, Courtney.
Hi, Miss Douglas, how are you? It's so good to see you.
How are the Shih Tzu's? - Um, they - I have the agenda for student council.
Could I please get 40 copies? I don't see why not.
Hi.
Lainie Jensen to see Principal Bolan.
Of course.
Um He will be with you in a moment.
You're Clay's mom.
Yes.
We love Clay.
We do too, most of the time.
I'll be right back.
Everybody loves Clay.
Hi, I'm Courtney.
[Gary] Your son is Clay.
Yes, Clay.
He's a junior this year.
How's he been handling the past few weeks? To be honest, I don't know for sure.
It's been difficult to tell.
We've lost two students in the space of two months.
It's been a difficult time for all of us.
Did he know Hannah Baker well? He says he didn't.
Either way, it's had such a terrible impact on everyone.
Hence you.
Yes, me.
Gary, I'd like to start with a conversation, nothing more.
Just about Liberty.
The climate here, the challenges.
It would be very helpful for me to have context.
Sure.
Anything you need.
Kevin Porter is a counselor here? Uh, yes.
And how many students is each counselor [woman] All right.
Have her come to my office.
[Tyler] They pantsed me in the middle of the hallway.
I don't know what that means.
They pantsed you? How could you not know what that means? You work at a high school.
The school I transferred from, kids shot kids.
Pants I don't know.
They just they just pulled my pants down.
- In the middle of the hallway.
- Who did? [sighs] I don't know.
Like, five people.
I don't understand how it is that I'm always getting screwed with, but I'm the one that gets sent to the office? Well, let's start with what is it that you can do to protect yourself? What is anything you're doing that might provoke kids? Are you serious? That's convenient.
Blame the victim.
No, no one's blaming anyone.
Okay, well, maybe we should be.
You should be blaming the kids that make this school a terrible place.
You should be blaming the kids that make other kids want to kill themselves.
Are you referring to Hannah Baker? What do you think? Do you want to talk about Hannah? Do you? If it's on your mind.
Isn't it on yours? Of course.
Yeah, I bet it is.
- Tyler.
- Nah, thanks.
Tyler.
[door closes] [indistinct chatter] I don't know what Justin's going to do.
He says he wants to shut Clay down.
[scoffs] We tried that.
Clay must have listened to his tape.
I told you, he listens to his tape, everything changes.
He hasn't listen to his tape.
He just heard Tyler.
He didn't say anything about Jessica's party.
But when he does, he'll probably believe Hannah.
He won't know that she's lying.
Clay's mom came to see Bolan.
What? Why? What else could it be? Clay wouldn't tell his mom about the tapes.
Why not? He wasn't shy about Tyler.
That would be so messed up if he told his mom.
I'm with Justin.
We need to do something serious.
What, so your mom doesn't find out? Yeah, among other people, like maybe your dad.
[Marcus] What can we do, if he's already ratted us out? I'm on track for valedictorian.
I do not need this shit.
Yes, Marcus, the most important thing right now is your valedictorian speech.
Let's keep that in mind.
You talking about Clay? Keep your voice down, dude.
Whatever you're doing, I want in.
We're not doing anything, Tyler.
It's not like we would trust you if we were.
This this isn't fair.
Dude, get the hell out.
Seriously.
I have a right to be here, guys I will snap your arm in two.
[Courtney] Let me deal with it.
Okay? Quietly.
No snapping of arms.
[Hannah] For days after Tyler's picture went around, I tried to catch your eye.
You ignored me for weeks.
But I decided enough was enough.
I wanted to talk to you.
I mean, we were in this together weren't we? Hey.
That seat's taken.
Yeah, by me.
Talk to me.
About what? I thought we were friends.
We are friends.
I mean, it seemed like we were.
Whatever you're going through now, you don't have to do it alone.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Like you said I know what it feels like to have people judge you.
And it sucks.
And it helps to have a friend who doesn't judge you.
[girl] I thought we were eating together.
Uh, sorry, I'll go.
See you around, Courtney.
No.
Stay.
Have lunch.
There's room for everybody.
We were gonna talk about the dance.
You're going, right? - Well, I - Can you drive? Because I'm restricted, and Courtney's dads are just strict, and Ashley's car's old.
- It's not that old.
- It's older than me.
[all laugh] [Mrs.
Baker] A limo? Honey, we can't afford a limo.
- What were you thinking? - How about we split it? I've got a bunch of money saved from the Crestmont.
A car for the night, with a driver? We're talking probably $500, probably more.
- Why don't you take the Jeep? - The Jeep is a hundred years old.
The Jeep's not a hundred years old.
It's not even paid off yet.
Why don't you take the station wagon? 'Cause that's so much better.
You guys, I'm trying to have friends, you know, like you guys are always talking about.
Sweetie, your friends are not going to like or dislike you for a car.
Mom, it's high school.
Of course they will.
Listen, I was in high school.
Yeah, but you have no idea, because you were popular, I'm not.
Hannah.
Yeah, well, it's true.
Well, you were.
No.
The answer is no.
[Mr.
Baker] They're coming to pick up the box.
"Evidence.
" So clinical.
Well it's their label.
Maybe we need to be looking through her room again.
We've been through No, we threw things in a box.
I mean, we need to dig deeper.
There's something we're missing.
They asked for schoolbooks, papers, photos, mementos.
Let's let them start with this and see what they say.
It's a full carton.
[door opens] Ah, honey.
Oh, you're beautiful.
Dad.
It's true.
I never looked so lovely for a dance.
That's ridiculous.
Hannah you are the most beautiful woman in this family.
I'd agree, but I'd be in trouble with both of you.
Here you are.
- Perfect.
- Aw, thanks, Dad.
It's beautiful.
Just a little smile.
Aah! Oh, come on, now.
There you go.
Honey, and I'm sorry.
I'm I'm sorry we couldn't afford to give you that limo.
Mom, it's okay, really.
Can I have the keys? You can.
You just have to take off the tag because Andy.
- You got a new car? - You got a new car? I upgraded the lease.
It's a simple trade.
- For the same payment? - A bit more.
[Hannah screams] It's worth it.
It's the winter formal, Liv.
Oh, it's it's great! - Thank you, Daddy.
- He's the hero, as always.
You're the best.
Go.
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Be careful! - [Hannah laughs] - [alarm chirps] Oh, my God! - [engine starts] - Well [Courtney] I love this car.
It has that new car smell.
Oh, my God.
Did your parents buy you a new car for this dance? Um Kind of.
Holy crap! I didn't know you were rich! Oh, my God.
Stephanie, you can think that shit, but you can't say it.
Oh designated driver.
Let's go in? [Courtney] Here we go! [rock music playing over speakers] Thanks.
Wow.
I know, right? It took the sophomores, like, two days, and I made them redo it twice.
[Tyler] Looking good, ladies.
Come on.
That's perfect.
Let's go dance.
Seriously, Tyler? It's for the yearbook.
I don't care.
Don't put it in my face.
Hannah.
You look good.
Hey.
Hey.
Who'd you come here with? Oh, just Courtney.
And her court.
The Courtnettes.
Yeah.
You? Big date? It was supposed to be.
Hey.
Uh, hey.
I should yeah.
Uh You look amazing.
Good enough to make your next list? Look, I'll say, like, a million times that I'm sorry.
- Don't say it.
- I love you.
You said it.
Wow.
- I'll say it again if that helps.
- No.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is this happening again? You're back together? Not unless this is the Hell Freezes Over dance.
Sad thing is, that'd be a really good theme.
Later.
Okay, seriously, how does he get all the hot girls? I mean his dick must be huge.
Only one huge dick in the vicinity at the moment, Bryce.
Whoo! She's talking about you, big guy.
Yeah, she is.
Sorry about him.
Lots of money, just no class.
Right.
[scoffs] You do look amazing, though.
Hey, where'd you guys go? Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
We thought you were right behind us.
Come dance with us.
Well, hello there, ladies.
So, are we gonna be seeing an encore presentation tonight, or what? What are you talking about? You're gonna try and tell me that these babes right here aren't you guys? Come on.
I know a fine piece when I see one.
Or two.
So, is this a thing now? Did you guys come here together? We came as friends.
Maybe one day you'll have some.
Oh, hey.
Aren't you supposed to get on the mic and say things like, "Hey, Liberty High, let's keep it tight!" I'm a legit deejay, not a birthday clown.
Those aren't the only options.
You see the world as binary.
It's a mosaic.
Oh, God.
Look at this mass of humanity.
Hundreds of stories.
It's kind of beautiful.
And romantic.
Yeah.
Kind of is.
[Jeff] Go.
Go get her.
Go get her and do what? It's a dance, right? Maybe dance with her? I can't You know I can't dance.
We talked about this when you forced me to come tonight.
Nobody can dance.
Look.
When people can dance at a dance, nobody likes 'em.
I didn't force you to come.
We made a bet, and I got higher than a "C," so you lost.
Now, go.
Come on.
[Tony] Clay.
Clay! You're missing out on the fun run.
It's three miles of torture.
What part of that is fun? Calling it fun is Orwellian.
And why do you care if I miss it? Who else is gonna call it Orwellian? [sniffs] Are you sure you didn't run already? I had a late night.
I'm aware.
Listen, Clay, what you did to Tyler, that's I don't want to hear it, Tony.
I feel you, brother, but still.
That shit's not helping.
I don't want to help.
I want to hurt.
Hurt who? Do you remember the winter dance, the one you deejayed? Sure.
You remember that song you played, that one slow song? That one slow song? Uh I'm gonna need some more, Clay.
It was the most amazing song.
- ["The Night We Met" playing] - Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh I am not the only traveler Who has not repaid his debt I've been searching For a trail to follow Again Take me back to the night we met You look adorable.
There's that word again.
- You look adorable.
- [rock music playing] There's that word again.
I didn't know you were here.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
I blend.
A skill I wish I had.
So, um I'm not really sure how this is done, uh, and I'm already being too formal.
Although it is the winter formal.
I don't know if people actually ask people this in the world, but I'm just saying I wonder if you want to dance.
I would love to dance.
Awesome.
Okay.
Cool.
[fast rock music continues] I don't think this is a song you can dance to.
Like, with someone.
Yeah.
I mean, we could just jump around together.
Oh.
You mean like this? Yeah, or, uh, or no, more more like this.
[Hannah laughing] - Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! - [Courtney] Whoo! Courtney Crimsen cuts loose! I like it! You here alone, or you with someone? I'm here with my friends.
We could be friends.
- Go! - Go! Do it.
You think so? Uh, you can keep up? Oh! [chuckles] Hey.
Maybe you and Hannah are up for some fun later.
- Me and Hannah? - Yeah.
You're fun girls, right? That's what it looks like in the picture.
Hate to disappoint you, Monty, but I'll tell you a secret.
[whispering] [Justin sputters] Oh, come on, keep up, be a man.
I'm way ahead of you.
Fine.
[Justin laughs] Holy fuck! I don't usually do hard liquor.
[laughing] [music stops] All right, Liberty High, let's slow it down a bit, nice and smooth.
["The Night We Met" playing] Well, you happy now? I am.
I'm embarrassed to admit that I am very happy.
Tony has amazing taste.
This song is perfect.
Yeah.
I am not the only traveler So, I guess we should Who has not repaid his debt I've been searching For a trail to follow Again Take me back to the night we met This song kinda reminds me of those old dance movies we play sometimes at the Crestmont.
Remember Strictly Ballroom? Oh, my God, I love that movie.
"There are no new steps!" You lied to me.
- What? - You said you had no rhythm.
You dance like a pro.
I've actually taken ballet since I was six.
No shit.
Seriously? No.
I would have believed it.
You're full of little surprises.
Yeah.
Stick with me, kid.
Stay with me? Stick with me.
Whatever.
Sorry.
Take me back to the night we met I don't know what I'm supposed to do Haunted by the ghost of you [loud laughing] Dear Lord.
I should go take care of that.
Yeah, for sure.
Hey, where's your girlfriend? Sorry, which girlfriend is that, exactly? Your girlfriend from the picture, Laura.
I hear you two like a guy between you now and then.
Who'd you hear that from? Courtney says you asked her for a three-way.
I don't blame you.
She's hot.
You've got to be fucking kidding me.
What, my intel's no good? - No, it's no good.
- See, I think it is.
'Cause she confirmed that not only did Justin finger you, but that you went down on him.
It's good shit.
Hannah.
Oh.
Hey, Cory.
What the fuck, Courtney? Hannah, I You think you can just throw me under the bus? "Everyone already thinks she's a slut.
So why not just pile on?" People were starting to talk.
I just I had I had to do something.
Yeah, well, you didn't have to do that.
I'm sorry.
I want to be your friend, Courtney.
I have been a friend to you, and this thing you're scared for people to know about you doesn't matter to me.
Okay, it doesn't fucking matter.
And I'm sorry if you're scared, but I'm not your shield, okay? You don't get to hide behind me.
You don't get to fuck with my life because you don't like who you are.
[bell rings] Courtney.
Hey.
Hey, Clay.
What's up? Listen, what you said the other day Uh-huh? I, um I haven't been doing so well, and I wonder if we could go somewhere and talk.
Yeah.
Of course.
Can you drive us? Maybe we could skip fifth? Sure.
Yes.
Meet me in the parking lot.
Okay? - Thanks.
Thanks, Courtney.
- Yeah.
[Hannah] But friends look out for each other, Courtney.
[Tony] All right, all right, Liberty High, listen up.
Last two dances.
Make 'em count.
[rock music playing over speakers] - Sorry, boys, fun's over.
- No! No, no, no! What are you I'm having fun! - Come on.
- See ya! Dude, that Hannah Baker's a fucking crazy lesbo, man.
Fuck off, Montgomery.
What the fuck are you talking about? - What's up, Foley? - Hey, Jeff.
Nothing.
Just fucking stupid high school dances.
There's vodka in the red shit if you want.
Nah, I'm good.
I'll be right back.
What happened? She left.
She just left.
Why? 'Cause 'Cause I think she thinks I care about shit I don't care about.
- I was having a good time.
- [alarm chirps] The sharks were in the water, Jess.
I pulled you into the boat.
That's what friends do.
You okay? Okay.
I really like Justin.
He's nice.
You shouldn't.
He isn't.
[sighs] There's water and crackers in the armrest thing.
- You should eat.
- Fine.
- Okay.
Watch your leg.
- Mm-hmm.
[gasps] Oh, my God! This is amazing.
I fucking love these peanut butter and cheese crackers, even though they don't taste like peanut butter or cheese.
God, you would make the best soccer mom, dude.
Thank you, Jess.
I'm sorry I slapped you that one time.
That wasn't cool.
[starter clicking] For fuck's sake.
I'm glad you came to me, Clay.
Look, everyone's been really good at keeping it secret.
No one's even told their parents.
Uh-huh.
[sniffs] Is that? Yeah, that smell is me.
You're really not doing so well.
No.
No, I'm not.
Hey it's good to talk to you about this.
Can I just I want to show you something.
Can I take you there? [Courtney] There's um, there's no headstone.
They take a couple months to make.
So, when someone dies suddenly - [Courtney] It's beautiful here.
- [scoffs] "It's beautiful here"? I don't know, Clay.
What do you want me to say? I'm not sure why you brought me here.
Because you've been acting like Hannah killing herself was some, like, school activity.
Like just a reason to put posters up.
I'm trying to help the school heal.
The school? Yeah.
What about you? Yes, all of us.
So you help the school, and cover the fact it's your fault too.
It's not my fault.
Clay, look, I know she was special to you.
And I know you're upset, and I get it, but but this was Hannah's choice.
Okay, this isn't on anyone but her.
No.
No, it's on every person who talked shit about her, and every guy who fucked her over, and it's on you because she thought you were a friend, and you sent one more asshole in her direction just to cover the fact you're gay.
That's not true.
I don't get it, Courtney.
It's the 21st century.
How is this so hard for you? Was it hard for you? Freshman year, when everyone thought you were gay? Well, it probably hurt my chances with girls, but they weren't so great before, so whatever.
I didn't lie to anybody about who I was.
- I didn't hurt anyone because of it.
- Neither did I.
We both know you did.
Christ, Courtney, you've got two gay dads! Yeah, and I have since I was in preschool, when no one had gay dads.
Do you have any idea what that's like? Even now.
I mean What if I were? What do you think everyone would say? "She's got two gay dads, that's why she's" And my dads, they've taken so much crap, my whole life, for being gay and then for being dads, and I just can't I couldn't do that to them.
What people think of you isn't more important than Hannah's life.
She needed you as a friend.
That's what should've mattered to you.
[sniffles] I got scared, okay? And I'm sorry.
I didn't know what to do.
[sniffs] I'm so sorry.
I'm not the one who needed to hear that.
[engine starts] Thanks, Tony.
You're a lifesaver.
A dozen people walked past this tragedy and all averted their eyes.
It's not a problem.
You should have texted me.
I would have come out before I packed up.
I love that you still use cassette tapes.
My parents still sell blank ones at the store.
I don't know why.
For mix tapes, of course.
A lost and essential art.
What's this? That starts with the song you and Clay danced to.
The slow one.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
See you around? Yeah.
Drive safe.
Thank you.
So, why the fuck would Clay take Courtney to Hannah's grave? I have no idea.
But if he's doing this now, what happens when he gets to the stuff about my party? Nothing happens, okay? I'm ending this shit right now.
He doesn't think that Hannah's lying.
He could tell people the wrong things.
He won't.
I'll take care of it.
How? Justin I don't want people to think What if people find out about what Hannah said, and then everyone starts to think something happened? No one's going to think anything's happened.
No one's going to think or say anything.
Clay's out of control.
I'll get him under control.
He's not gonna hurt you.
I know what you're gonna say.
It's the song you asked about.
The one you and Hannah danced to.
You could have given it to me at school.
Did you pick my lock? I saw you guys turn down Cemetery Road I didn't think you'd be getting a ride back.
And I think it was time I saw this too.
Since the family didn't have a funeral, and I didn't feel like coming by myself.
It's not the kind of thing you do if you're not ready, Clay.
You mean Courtney.
I saw her driving out of here.
She looked pretty fucked up.
When I listen to the tapes I want to see her in school tomorrow.
I want to eat Mike and Ikes out of the box with her at the Crestmont.
I want to dance with her again, and kiss her when I should have kissed her.
But I can't.
Don't you feel like someone should pay for that? Aren't you? Aren't you paying? [horn blaring] - What the hell? - Wanna go for a ride real quick? No.
We think you do.
What the hell, man? What are you doing? Get in the car.
Come on, I'll take you home.
Why are you doing this? What else am I gonna do? I don't understand.
You will.
Just get in the car.
[Mrs.
Baker] I understand.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for letting us know.
[phone beeps] We knew it might go to trial.
They've hired Caproni, Burkhardt and Goodell.
It's a big firm.
I've seen them in the newspapers.
So they're playing to win.
We'll do the same.
They're gonna go after our girl.
What are you guys doing? [tires screeching] Yo, Alex.
We know what you did to Courtney.
Jesus, Alex, slow down.
You know, you've really got to stop fucking with people, Clay.
Just slow down.
[horns blaring] Okay, I will, I'll stop.
Just slow down.
Alex, slow down! - I'll stop! - Okay, okay.
Ease up, we're good.
Alex, I think he gets it.
Slow down.
What the hell, dude, slow down! - [car horn blares] - [siren] Oh, shit, Alex.
Alex, seriously, slow the fuck down.
Seriously, Alex.
Ever been to jail before? Okay, you boys want to tell me why you're going 90 in a 40? We were just out for a ride.
- We're sorry, officer.
- Yeah.
Well, you know, I could bust you for reckless driving.
You know how much that ticket would be? Five hundred dollars and three points on your license.
You want that? No, sir.
I suggest you drop these boys off and get your ass home in time for dinner.
- All right.
You be home in time? - Tell Mom to save me a plate.
And stick to the speed limit, kid.
'Cause next time, I'll ticket you.
Seat belt.
Night, Dad.
No shit.
Your dad's a cop? Yep.
[Justin] That's fucking brilliant! You can't touch us, Clay.
You got that? We're fucking bulletproof.
[laughs] Come on, let's go.
["The Night We Met" playing on headphones] Take me back to the night we met I don't know what I'm supposed to do Haunted by the ghost of you Take me back to the night we met When the night was full of terror [music stops] What you listening to? Nothing.
One of Tony's mix tapes.
Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, great.
Clay, I need to talk to you.
Do you know anything about any kids getting bullied at your school? Why, did someone call you? No.
I'm asking whether you knew if Hannah Baker was bullied.
Why Hannah Baker? My firm was hired today by the school to defend them in the lawsuit that the Bakers have filed.
Your firm? Doesn't the school have their own lawyers? They do.
But for a lawsuit, they need litigators.
Like me.
You're going up against the Bakers? Well, I'm defending the school.
But you're a parent of a kid at the school.
I think that's one reason the partners asked me to take the case.
So you're going to try to prove that Hannah wasn't bullied.
The school's position is that they didn't know about any bullying, and they would have stopped it if they had.
You believe that's true? I believe we'll find out.
Oh.
Are you okay with that? Sure.
You have nothing more to tell me about bullying at school? No.
Or, um Hannah Baker? Look, I told you, Mom I didn't really know her.
["Thirteen" playing] Won't you let me walk you home From school Won't you let me meet you at the pool Maybe Friday I can Get tickets for the dance And I'll take you Won't you tell your dad Get off my back Tell him what we said 'Bout "Paint It Black" Rock-n-roll is here to stay Come inside Well, it's okay And I'll shake you Won't you tell me what You're thinking of Would you be an outlaw for my love If it's so, well let me know If it's no, well I can go I won't make you 

The fuck! Man, people are trying to walk here! The fuck is your problem? - Dude, Alex, chill.
It's all good.
- Oh, it's all good? You think you can run people over like everyone else at the fucking school? - You're tripping, man.
- Okay.
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car! I'm gonna kick your fucking ass! Get out! Get out! - Alex, calm the fuck down.
- You calm down! I am calm! Man, I'm so fucking calm.
You don't want to do this.
- You think I'm scared of you? - You should be.
Fuck you! Ooh! How many of you remember the Oh My Dollar Valentines? Those were fun, weren't they? You fill out a survey, and for just a buck, you get the name and number of your one true soul mate.
And, hey, all proceeds go to a worthy cause: cheer camp.
Sheri, I am so sorry, but those hearts look like butts.
They do.
The Dollar Valentine survey was a two-parter: Describe yourself, and describe what you're looking for in someone else.
And, as I filled mine out, I realized I was actually describing a certain someone.
You'd think if my answers all described one person that person would at least appear in my Top Five.
But no.
I didn't match up to the one person who might really have been right.
Maybe it wasn't my fault.
Maybe none of us can say who we truly are.
What the fuck? This is not good.
Maybe we're more than what the world sees.
Or less.
Maybe none of us are who we seem.
- Stop it.
I said stop it.
- All right! - God.
- Come on, man.
What the hell is going on? - He started it.
- Yeah? So what are you doing? Finishing it? You think that's funny? Yeah? Come on, let's go.
Everybody, go to class.
Show is over.
Go to class! Where you going, Clay? - Where's my bike? - I'm gonna hold onto it for a while.
And you're gonna keep quiet, right? What are you gonna do, Justin? Beat the shit out of me, too? Go ahead.
I'll do it if I have to.
Okay.
You know where to find me.
Let's go, Alex.
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so fine.
All right.
Nurse? Then we go to the vice principal.
I said I'm fine.
No, you're not.
Come on.
You, too.
Come on.
Was it a fair fight, or did Montgomery pound the snot out of him and leave us open to more charges of bullying? Which is exactly what we don't need right now.
Well, Alex started it, but ended up getting hurt pretty bad.
This was in front of the library? This was down in the street, by the tennis courts.
But in the street? Which is off the school grounds.
But they were on their way in.
We don't have jurisdiction over town streets.
So, what, we just let 'em off? It seems like to me, especially now, we need to be giving them, like, consequences and boundaries.
We need to be protecting our future ability to give them anything.
But what about the Student Honor Board? The Honor Board generally deals with cheating and minor theft.
They're a smart group, though.
Good kids.
And this way, the school's not held responsible.
There's some justice and some closure.
You okay? Did you Did you see that? I couldn't watch.
I don't know why people act like that.
People can be fucking assholes.
It's a school full of assholes.
I mean, right? But I don't think you're an asshole.
That's very kind.
And I don't think you're a I mean, can girls be assholes? Oh, yeah.
Trust me.
So, yeah.
You're not.
Hey, did you finish your paper for Miss Cusick? That All About the Pretty Horses thing? Yeah, it's, uh, due tomorrow.
Oh, shit, I thought we had, like, another week for that.
No.
Well, I should probably get to the library.
See you in history.
See you.
Hey, Sheri.
Listen, I could Like, if you wanted to, I could help you finish the paper.
Oh, my God! Clay, really? Thank you.
I mean that damn book is hard.
Like, the sentences are so long, then it's, like, in Spanish We only have 20 minutes before the first bell rings.
We could also work on it after school.
Maybe at Monet's? Oh, my God.
I mean, that would be amazing.
You sure you don't mind? Not at all.
I used to be a peer tutor.
So Well? Complete sentences, right? Yeah, totally.
I even used a semicolon.
I saw that.
Mad props.
I'm just saying.
Paragraph structure's good.
Might need some fact-checking.
Seriously? I Googled everything.
Well, the Founding Fathers did grow and use hemp - but it wasn't weed, exactly.
- Those are different? Yeah.
Yeah, so James Madison probably wasn't a mad stoner, or, uh, at least not from the hemp.
But it's a good start.
I marked a few other facts to recheck.
Sometimes actual books are more reliable for this kinda stuff.
Right, right.
Good point.
I'll get right on it.
It's just I don't know.
This is These Dollar Valentines, they're personal to people.
Everything I publish is personal to people.
- Yeah.
- I elide the names.
I'm gonna assume that means "cross out.
" - Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, well, I get it.
Still It, uh, it feels wrong.
I'm just being honest.
Well, thank you for your honesty.
Until the Dollar Valentines offer same-sex options for match-making, I will continue to take them on.
He's really serious about the 'zine.
He's serious about the 'zine, his shoes, and not much else.
What are you working on? Oh, nothing.
It's nothing.
Dollar Valentine survey? No, no, no, no, no.
You really don't have to Dude, relax.
Okay.
"How do I spend my Saturday nights?" You answered, "video games.
" Favorite kind of music, "obscure indie bands.
" Favorite reading materials, "fantasy and sci-fi"? Dude, why not just say you watch Lord of the Rings on repeat.
I don't do that.
Anymore.
You used to do that? We need to work on this, man.
- No, we don't.
- Listen, dude.
I needed a "C" average or above to play baseball.
U.
S.
History was kicking my ass.
And I got help, right? What about you, dude? How's your dating life? "C" average or above? Below.
So you need help.
Man's got a point.
All these answers suck.
Hannah Baker! Hey! Did you fill out a survey? Yeah, well, I figured why not.
This is so cool.
I've always wanted to set you up with someone.
Let's see.
How does this thing work, anyway? I don't know really, but Prakash Agrawal in Mr.
Merrimen's A.
P.
Computer Science came up with it.
He says it's like a proprietary algorithm.
He's gonna license it to us for free as an act of charity, and it's gonna make him millions someday.
Let's see.
Who'd you get? Who'd you get? How did I match with Bryce Walker? No.
Not that one.
Trust me.
Okay, agreed.
Um, let's see What about Alex Standall? He's nice.
Yeah, well, this time you can trust me he's not.
Maybe I was stupid to keep hoping.
Hoping for someone great.
Why is Marcus Cole calling me? No way.
It's Dollar Valentine.
What? Okay, well, I shouldn't be telling you this, but I'm pretty sure you were on his list.
Oh, please answer.
We need a success story.
People are asking for their money back.
We need that for the banner budget.
I don't know.
Please, Hannah Baker? Banners! - Hello? - Hey, Hannah Baker.
Guess what? Hey, Marcus Cole.
What? You were first on my list for Dollar Valentines.
Dollar Valentines.
That is shocking.
I'm shocked.
Say yes, yes, yes.
Text me everything.
Right? Yeah.
I figured it was a sign.
Yeah, but wait a second.
How do I know you're telling the truth? Maybe I'm not on your list.
Hey, well, if you go out with me, I can show you.
- Says you.
- Says me.
And my dead president friend, Benjamin Franklin, who was actually not a president.
It is ready to buy you milkshakes, hamburgers, French fries, anything you want from the world-renowned Rosie's Diner.
Come on, what do you say? Eight p.
m.
? - Listen - Nope, no "listen.
" What follows "listen" is nothing good.
Let me put it this way.
Repeat after me: "Marcus, I will definitely go out with you.
" I always kind of liked Marcus.
Marcus, I will definitely think about it.
You always seemed like a good guy.
Don't think too hard.
I promise.
I won't.
Then again, they almost always do.
Marcus, welcome to your tape.
What was it? Did you want to see if the rumors were true? Or did you just want to start some new ones of your own? Okay, so, this emergency meeting of the Honor Board is called to order.
Marcus Cole, presiding.
Courtney Crimsen, recording secretary.
All members present.
Petitioners, please state your names.
That's you, guys.
- Alex Standall.
- Montgomery de la Cruz.
So, Montgomery, this case seems pretty straightforward.
- You were the one driving.
- So? So the pedestrian has the right of way.
That is the law.
And you were walking when he almost hit you? Wasn't just me.
Heroji Pratt, Jin-seo Yoon, Chase Parker.
I don't know.
They were all there.
You're the one who acted like a fucking psycho.
Hey.
Watch the language.
And you were reckless driving.
You could've killed somebody.
It's our job to protect the students of this school.
To protect the students at this school? Yes, Alex.
That's what the Honor Board is for, to settle disputes among students so they don't spill out into the hallways.
Yeah, the Honor Board, 'cause you're all so honorable.
Alex, this happened off-campus, so the alternative is the police.
Okay.
Great, let's make a call then.
No one needs to make a call.
There's no crime.
We can deal with it here.
So anyone can get away with anything at this school and no one gives a fuck? Language, Alex, please.
We're just saying that it was no one's fault.
Okay? It just happened.
It didn't just happen.
I mean, maybe I was driving a little too fast, but Alex lost his shit.
Yeah, see? I lost my shit.
It's my fault.
Goddamn it, hey! Watch your language! I'm taking some fucking responsibility.
Since you guys can't.
If Alex says it was his fault Doesn't matter what Alex says.
But it was his fault.
- No, it's your fault.
- It's not his fault.
Maybe it's all your faults.
Did that ever occur to any of you? And I just keep thinking if only someone else could have had me on their list.
Then maybe maybe it could have all been different.
Yo, Picasso.
You resting up for a big date tonight or something? Me? No.
What about Dollar Valentines? I, uh I didn't really do it.
Couldn't afford it, huh? Yeah.
What, uh What about you? Did you? Yep.
Well, uh, you know my motto: no cheerleader left behind.
You get any good matches? Not one.
- I got Bryce Walker.
- Holy shit, really? Either you made a serious error in the "Who I'm looking for" section - or that algorithm is messed up.
- Probably both.
I'm always looking for the wrong person.
I did get a call from Marcus Cole.
He said I was on his list.
Are you gonna go out with him? Well, he's not my first choice.
- But, um - Jensen.
What's up, Clay? Hey, Jeff.
Let me guess: You two are seeing Never Say Goodbye for Valentine's Day.
No, we're seeing Thirty Ways to Die.
You're a classy date.
Yeah.
Yeah, I am.
What's up with you, man? How'd that Dollar Valentine work out? I thought you said you didn't do it.
I thought you were gonna you told me We're gonna see our movie.
Well, which is it? What I meant was, I didn't really get any decent matches.
Jeff made me do it.
He's always making me do things, like go to dances.
Anyway, I did the earlier shift so I could do something tonight.
I guess I should call Marcus.
Yeah, I guess so.
Hey, Marcus, it's Hannah.
I thought about it, and the answer is yes.
I get off work at eight.
All right, I'll see you then.
Well, that was easy.
It can be.
I'll do towels and T.
P.
before I take off.
Okay, so Montgomery, it is the decision of the Honor Board that you are to be suspended from Liberty High School for three consecutive school days, starting tomorrow.
That's fucking bullshit.
That is fucking bullshit.
All right.
That is enough, or you both are gone.
And, um Alex, you're going to be let off with a warning.
- What? - Oh, come on.
- With a warning this time.
- Fucking hypocrites.
Alex.
It's the right amount of time.
I just hope he got it.
Yeah.
All right, take care.
Thanks.
The hell was that? You tell me.
Alex started that fight.
This isn't the time for any of us to be stirring shit up.
Understand what I'm saying? No, what are you saying? People start asking questions.
Those tapes get out, it I thought you said you didn't listen to the tapes.
This isn't just us.
This isn't just a school thing.
There's a lawsuit.
Lives could get ruined.
Seems like lives have already been ruined, don't you think? Any luck? What in any of this could possibly be called luck? You're right.
Sorry.
We're missing something.
I know we are.
Honey, we've been through this room a dozen times.
Maybe there's nothing more to find.
I refuse to believe that our daughter was this much of a mystery to us.
I'm just gonna keep looking.
- Until you find what? - Whatever we need to win this case.
You heard the lawyers on the phone this morning.
They said we only have circumstantial evidence.
And they said that's usually the case with trials like this.
Andy how did we not know? How did I not know? She was right here.
And she was in pain, she was reaching out, and we just kept pretending everything was okay.
Honey, I think we just need to keep things in perspective.
We can't only blame ourselves or be looking for signs everywhere.
Okay? Maybe we should be blaming ourselves.
I mean, if we weren't so preoccupied with the fucking store.
- The store's how we survive.
- No, no, no.
The store was to get you out of that company that was killing you to get us out of that shitty suburban wasteland.
And if my parents hadn't given us that loan Ah, the loan.
Yes.
The loan.
Always the loan.
If we hadn't taken that loan and bought the store and moved here, then Hannah would still be in that giant, faceless high school with those hateful girls, and maybe things would have ended just the way they did.
How can you say that? How can we know? Oh, Mom! Happy Valentine's Day, sweetie.
This is awkward and embarrassing, and so nice.
But I'm not supposed to be your valentine.
Sweetheart, you're always going to be my valentine.
It's a little creepy, don't you think? You're not trying to turn me into Norman Bates or something, are you? You know what, that movie theater job I don't think it's healthy for you.
Well why are you here? Aren't you and Dad doing anything for Valentine's Day? Ooh! No, no, no, no, no.
When you've been married as long as we have, the best you can hope for is takeout and some red wine.
That's not true.
He buys you flowers all the time.
That's true.
He does.
And sometimes he cooks.
Well he heats things up very well.
Well, I think you guys are so lucky.
I think what you guys have is perfect.
Well, sweetie, nothing's perfect, but we are very lucky.
All three of us.
- Open your card, babe.
- Okay.
My parents were high school sweethearts.
So shoot me: I still believed in romance.
Thank you so much for taking time to help me with this.
No, I'm glad.
It's cool.
I've been working on this project, and I could use a break.
This book is a break? Well, helping you.
I will get coffee.
Uh - Um, what's your drink? - Um Double mocha with extra little chocolate sprinkles, please.
Nice.
How may I help you, sir? Uh Hey, Skye.
Um, Triple Americano, and a double mocha with extra little chocolate sprinkles.
Extra little chocolate sprinkles.
Got it.
So, what? You're into cheerleaders now? It's you and Carrie? Sheri.
You guys make a cute couple.
You can go with her to Abercrombie and watch her try on pre-distressed jean shorts and gladiator sandals.
That is oddly specific.
I just I didn't think you were the cheerleader type.
She's a good person.
She's nice.
So you only like nice girls? That's not what I said.
I just thought you were cooler than a Sheri.
I waited for you, Marcus.
And I just had to sit there, wondering.
Imagining.
Playing over all the different scenarios in my mind.
And all the while thinking that they all knew everyone in the whole place that I'd been stood up on Valentine's Day.
I decided to give you one more chance.
Stupid Hannah.
So, this site says that one of John Grady Cole's central flaws is his tendency to see the world in black and white, good and evil Sheri.
Do you remember Dollar Valentines last year? What? Dollar Valen I mean, yeah, I guess I remember.
Why? Hannah matched with Marcus.
Did she? Oh, yeah, right, yeah, she did.
I actually told her she should go out with him.
I think she said it wasn't that great.
Was there someone else? Someone who wasn't on her list? Or did she mention any other name? I don't know, I can't really remember.
Why? Nothing, nothing, it's Never mind, let's just keep going.
Hey, Sheri what would you think about going somewhere else to work? Uh, okay, sure.
You live near here, right? Uh Yeah, kind of.
We could work at your house.
Right, yeah.
We could.
Or, I mean Or Rosie's? No, no.
My house works.
- Great.
- Cool.
Um Listen, I'll meet you outside? Okay.
Hey, Clay.
Long time, no see.
And I mean that sarcastically.
You still on that big crusade? Maybe not.
Maybe I'm getting back to my life, and, you know, people who aren't completely fucked up.
Well, good luck with that.
So you can stop following me.
I'm not following you.
I drink coffee.
I thought you said the coffee here is overpriced.
Yeah, he says that all the time.
Clay, Brad.
Brad Clay.
Uh, hey.
Uh, I'm not following you.
And if you leave, which I suggest you do, you'll see.
What was that all about? It's nothing.
What do you mean, nothing? He said you'd been following him.
He's just a little out of his head lately.
Too much caffeine.
That's the kid who keeps texting you? Uh one of them, yeah.
How many are there? I told you it was just school stuff.
Forget it? Thought you didn't get caught up in high school bullshit.
I don't.
Then what was that? It's nothing.
It's not nothing.
I I just think it's something you don't want to let me be part of.
On this particular issue, I can't.
I have a secret that I have to keep.
Got more than one, I think.
Hey.
Oh.
Hey, Mom, I thought you'd be at work.
I finally caved and brought some work home.
There's going to be late nights on this one.
Hi, Sheri.
Hey, Ms.
Jensen.
How's your mom? She's good.
Looks like a big case.
We're going to go up to my room to work on a paper for English.
Sounds good.
Oh, Clay, honey, keep the door open.
Oh, my God, yes, Mom, fine.
I think you're lucky your parents are still together.
I mean, it's rare.
I guess.
I think they're bonded by their shared love of humiliating me in every way possible.
Wasn't enough to keep mine together.
I don't think I can imagine promising to love someone forever.
But if you can do that, then how can it just be over? Like that, you know? People fall out of love, I guess.
Well, that sucks.
Yeah, but at least it means they fell in love in the first place.
Right.
Um - Hi.
- Hey.
Be quiet.
Mom's going through one of her things.
You didn't answer your phone or my texts.
- I know, 'cause my mom.
- I needed to see you.
Okay, just be quiet.
- We need to talk.
- Okay! Just be quiet, all right? Okay.
What's going on? I was just I looked for you after practice.
Yeah, my mom needed me.
She broke up with her boyfriend.
She's all fucked up.
They let Alex off.
Things are getting messed up.
Things are fine.
That fight? Some scary shit.
Yeah, it was a fight.
Yeah, Alex got hurt real bad.
Why the fuck are you so worried about Alex? I'm not! Hey.
Can I stay here for a while? No, you know how my mom gets when she's like this.
I know.
I'll make it worth your while.
Hmm? Jess.
Relax.
- Come on, Jess.
- Relax.
- Jess.
- Relax, it's fine.
Jess, what the fuck is going on with you? Come on.
Come on.
Stop! What the fuck, Justin? - I told you, my mom - Your mom what? Huh? It never stopped you before.
- You're a real fucking prick.
- Yeah, whatever.
To me, the thing about the story that's so sad - is John Grady, you know? - Mm-hmm.
He has everything he wants.
He's made it all across Mexico to this ranch, and he's training wild horses and he has everything he's been looking for but he gives it all up for this girl.
That doesn't sound sad to me.
That sounds romantic.
Yeah, no.
It is.
Uh, but she's the boss's daughter, so uh, being with her is dangerous, you know? But he does it anyway.
Yeah, she comes down from the main house in the middle of the night to be with him.
And then what happens? Well, he falls in love with her.
And she falls in love with him? Yeah.
And then you finally showed up.
Except you weren't alone.
The fuck, Marcus? I've been sitting here for an hour.
Sorry.
Hey, you want a milkshake or something? I still have that Founding Father, Benjamin Franklin in my wallet.
I already had a milkshake.
Yeah, I had two milkshakes.
Okay.
Well, then fries? A cheeseburger? A stomach pump? Damn it, Marcus.
Come on, come on, what do I have to do to make you forgive me? Nothing.
Just sit down.
I'm I'm sorry, Hannah.
I really am.
So why'd you bring the entourage? You scared you're not safe out here on your own with me? Actually, um, those guys are my unpaid interns.
I have them do all my menial tasks.
Oh yeah? You give 'em college credit? Well, that's what I tell them, anyway.
I don't get it.
What's his play? He's an hour late.
Make a girl wait if she's still there after you show, you know she's DTF.
What's DTF? Dude, spell it out.
It's already letters.
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, can I have a sip of your milkshake? Knock yourself out.
And, again, you were funny, Marcus.
And I thought maybe just maybe it was going to be all right.
Is this - is this okay? - Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it's okay.
It's good.
Good, yeah.
This is good.
Clay what are you thinking about? I'm sorry.
Shit.
I'm sorry.
What happened? Did I do something? No, no.
God, no.
It's I don't know.
Um Look, it's okay if you don't like me like that.
No I like you.
I do.
I You were thinking of someone else.
No, Sheri, I wasn't You were thinking of Hannah.
I wasn't.
That's okay.
I wasn't I wasn't thinking of anyone.
But but you.
I like you.
Yeah? - Yeah.
- You think I'm a good person? Of course I do.
I always have.
Well, you shouldn't.
What? Why are you crying? Look, Clay, I I thought that that maybe if if you didn't listen to my tape, then you would still like me.
You would see that I'm not that person.
You're on the tapes? You didn't know? No, I haven't listened to them all.
I I did something Hannah and I, but I did it.
And it's horrible, and I can't Look I can't tell you what it is, and I don't want you to know, 'cause I don't want you to look at me that way, and it would kill me if you heard what were on those tapes.
What did you do? Clay, please.
It's over.
The damage is done, and - I just wish that - You wish I'd give up the tapes.
You want me to pass them on, just like Marcus? - Just like everyone? - Clay.
This is why you're here? Why you've been so nice to me? Why you kissed me? Oh, my God, Clay, no.
I think you should leave.
- Clay, it - Just go! Jesus Christ.
It's good! It was good an hour ago.
It's still good.
You know, we don't have to stay here if you don't want.
My parents are out of town.
- What are you doing? - What? Nothing.
Just - Seriously, Marcus? - What? - You're such an asshole.
- Come on.
No.
Stop it, no.
Get off me.
Don't touch me! Get off! - Hey, what the fuck? - Get away from me.
No sweat.
Thought you were easy.
Let's go.
I couldn't move.
I couldn't get up and leave or scream.
Anything would have been better than sitting there thinking that somehow this was my fault.
Thinking I'd be alone the rest of my life.
Clay? Honey? What? What happened, sweetie? Is everything okay? I'm fine.
You're not fine.
I'm your mother.
I can tell you're not fine.
You haven't been for a while.
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't care.
Why are you taking that case, Mom? Why are you getting involved with all that? Is that why you're upset? Isn't it a conflict of interest? Why would it be? Tell me.
Are you being bullied? Am I being bullied? You really want to know? What if I was the bully, Mom? Would you want to know that? You would never be a bully.
How do you know? Because I know you.
Because you're a good kid.
Maybe there aren't any good kids.
I have to get ready for bed.
Clay, honey.
If this case could hurt you in any way then I won't take it.
But you have to tell me why.
You have to tell me what's going on.
I can't help you if you don't talk to me.
You can't help anyway, Mom.
But through it all you want to believe there are good guys in this world.
I knew there were.
Too much? I thought they were beautiful.
I'm sorry for for what I said and how I said it.
I'm sorry, too.
I love you.
And we will keep going and keep searching and keep fighting for as long as you want to.
As long as we have to.
Whatever they throw at us it's you and me against the world.
Thank you.
I love you, too.
These are lovely.
I'll go put 'em in some water.
Yeah.
Lights out, Jess.
Everything okay? Yeah.
Is it that Justin Foley? He do something to you? No, Dad.
'Cause, you know, if he did, I'd kill him, right? Dad.
If anybody does anything to you, I'd just Can you stop.
Oh, my God.
Well, you remember that.
Good night.
How are you feeling? Ice packs helping? Yes, sir.
That's good.
I just got off the phone with the counselor.
He said that other boy got suspended for three days.
Yes, sir.
But you weren't disciplined at all.
No, sir.
- Just gave me a warning.
- Good.
You stood up for yourself.
Sounds like you stood up for those other kids, too.
I guess.
No.
That De la Cruz kid was in the wrong.
He could've hurt somebody really bad.
And you took him to task for it.
Yes, sir.
You paid a price.
That's what we gotta do sometimes.
Look, Alex, I know fighting isn't your thing, and you should avoid fighting when you can, but sometimes you can't.
Okay? You showed real strength of character.
You always do.
We don't agree on everything, but we can agree on that.
Proud of you, pal.
All right.
That's all I got, kiddo.
Get some sleep.
Yes, sir.
Night.
Fun fact.
I did some research on tombstones the other day.
Or, more specifically, on epitaphs on tombstones.
The best one I could find was by this writer called Henry Charles Bukowski, Jr.
On his tombstone, he has engraved the picture of a boxer and beneath the boxer, two simple words: "Don't try.
" I wonder what will be on mine.

You're going to tell me this one's no big deal but let me tell you about being lonely.
Humans are a social species.
We rely on connections to survive.
Even the most basic social interactions help keep us alive.
Statistics prove the subjective feeling of loneliness can increase the likelihood of premature death by 26%.
If it sounds like I'm quoting from a school textbook I am.
Too bad nobody bothered to read it.
And let me tell you there's all kinds of ways to feel lonely.
Matt, I was gonna do that.
I thought I'd get you started.
Your workday seems to be getting longer and longer.
Any news from Clay this morning? I heard the stirrings.
Some, uh thumps and mutterings and such.
We need to get him back to Dr.
Ellman.
He won't take the meds, but the talk therapy was always helpful.
Aah! Feel like it was more helpful for you to have him doing it.
Yes.
It was helpful to know that he was talking to somebody.
What's wrong with that? Not everyone shares your passionate belief that all problems can be solved with words.
Christ's sakes, Matt, you have a PhD in literature.
- Your whole life is about words.
- And how they complicate everything.
He is in trouble, and we need to help him.
He's acting out, yes.
We don't know that he's in trouble.
There's a reason the school's sending out so many e-mails.
"Contagion.
" "Suicide clusters.
" A girl died, Lainie, and he said he barely knew her.
Hannah Baker didn't just die.
She slit her wrists and bled out in a bathtub.
Clay.
I have to go to school.
I haven't made your lunch yet.
I'll buy lunch.
I'm not talking the garden variety lonely in a crowd lonely.
That's everyone, every day.
And it's not that "when will I find love" kind of lonely.
Or that "the popular kids are mean to me" kind of lonely.
The popular kids are always mean.
That's how they get popular.
I know.
Ironic.
Old news.
Hey! - Hey, what the hell? What are you doing? - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What the hell? I can't get it open.
Why do you want to? Because it's my locker.
I'm new, but I can't get the combination to work.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
Uh This locker used to belong to a friend of mine.
Um, thank you.
The kind of lonely I'm talking about is when you feel you've got nothing left.
Nothing.
And no one.
Like you're drowning, and no one will throw you a line.
Why did you do it? Why did you do it? Do what? What you did to Hannah.
That was really fucked up.
What did you say? I said thanks for helping me.
That was really nice.
Oh.
Sure.
Which way is the science wing? Uh, out those doors.
Take a left.
Well, when the subject of this tape worked his sneaky magic that's how I was feeling.
And when you're that kind of lonely, you reach for anything no matter how silly it may seem.
I'm sick of it, you know? Just because I don't have her skinny-ass body doesn't mean I'm fat! And communications class could be supremely silly as you know.
Maybe she should try a diet.
Seriously, Pratters? Jesus! I'm just saying, all right, if you're getting fat-shamed, then you know, don't be fat.
Mr.
Pratters! Pratter's, that's like someone saying to you, "Don't be an idiot and a dickwad.
" - Can't help it.
- Exactly.
Thank you.
Totally not on your side, dude.
All right, people, so remember the compliment bags.
Um, it's always best to give a compliment face to face, but sometimes it's easier to be anonymous.
All right.
See you tomorrow.
I always feel stupid.
Looking? Yeah.
Yeah.
These are the stupidest, most embarrassing things that I check every day, no matter what.
Right.
Sometimes the silly things can mean more than anyone knows.
Get a good one? Nothing earthshaking.
You? Nada.
It's kind of soul-crushing, you know? Seriously? He's Zach Dempsey.
Does he really need compliments? We all need it.
Human contact.
And communications class, crazy as it was, was human contact for me.
Until someone in that class cut my lifeline someone who is known for being sweet.
I'll tell you who it is but you're going to have to wait.
Just like I did.
You don't look so good.
I think I'm listening to my tape.
You're finally gonna get what you deserve.
It's about time.
What? I said let me know if you need to talk.
Any time.
Yeah, thanks.
I'm going to play mind games with you, just like you played with me.
No.
No, I-I didn't.
No, I didn't.
It happened after Valentine's Day when you really feel that lack of human contact.
Especially when you make contact with the wrong human.
Get off me! Don't touch me! Get off! Hey, what the fuck! Get away from me.
That's a whole new level of lonely.
But through it all you still want to believe there are good guys in the world.
You were kind that night.
You just sat there, letting me ignore you until it was almost comical.
I'm sorry about Marcus.
He just He can just be such a dick.
You know? Want to see a cool trick? Bryce Walker taught me.
See, the thing is you gotta get the positioning just right.
I swear, Bryce has a magnet face.
He can keep, like, five on at once.
It's crazy.
Okay.
You two want to order some food? Hannah? Do you want anything? I mean, after all, it's it's still Dollar Valentine.
I think we're just gonna take the check.
Are you kidding? What's a couple of milkshakes? After the way you played on Saturday, it's on me.
Thanks, man, that's uh, that's really nice.
Listen.
Take it easy.
Okay? You'll feel better tomorrow.
You were so sweet.
Just like Kat said, once upon a time.
So sweet.
Well, welcome to your tape, Zach.
- Yo.
- Yo, Big "Z"! Yo, dude! There he is! For those who aren't Zach, you can relax.
For now, at least.
As for you, Zach I wonder if you ever felt what it's like to be lonely.
Like I did that day.
Is it even possible to know when you're one of the most popular jocks and not one of those kids who sits alone in the cafeteria, hiding behind a book? Have you ever noticed us? I can't get my strength! Take a handful, boys.
Start passing these babies out.
Fuck me! How many of these did Daddy make you? Enough to win the election.
Hey, I'll be right back, guys.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh.
What you reading? A book.
Um - Listen, about last night - It's okay.
I'm over it.
Okay, this this isn't about Marcus.
I never got the chance to say something.
The thing is you were the Valentine I was hoping for.
What? I was hoping that I'd get your name on my you know, the valentine list thing.
Because I'm easy.
No.
Seriously, no.
Look The whole night with Marcus and everything I couldn't believe you were on his list and not mine.
Zach I don't know if you're doing this on a dare or whatever.
It's not a dare.
It's not.
I just I know you think every guy likes you because you've got this great ass.
But I like you for so much more than that.
Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.
What? What'd I say? The fact that you don't even know.
I meant it as a compliment.
Zach, walk away.
Come on, I know why you're pissed at Marcus - Zach, go.
- If you just gave me a chance Leave me alone! Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry.
This shit that happens to you I think some of it you bring on yourself.
Is that what you think? Thanks for the insight, genius.
I was I was trying to be nice.
Well, you failed.
Well, fuck you.
Dude, seriously.
What's the point of even attempting with that girl? Yeah, been there, forgot that.
Don't you need every vote, Marcus? I don't need that one! Guys, leave Zach alone.
He's just desperate to lose it before his dad has to buy him a hooker.
You get back here, young man! Zachy! Poor Zach! Yo, Zachy! You said something stupid, Zach and I yelled at you.
Big deal.
You should have let it go.
But you didn't let it go.
You didn't like that someone told you no.
'Cause guys like you get anything you want, right? You're home early.
Hey.
Come sit with me a minute.
This isn't a talk, is it? No talk.
We'll communicate through semaphores.
I can see how you'd think I'd be the one person to laugh at that, but Where's your bike? Uh I uh messed up the crank so I left it with Tony, to fix it.
Listen.
About what you heard this morning.
I didn't hear anything.
Well, if you did your mom and I we disagree on some things.
I didn't hear anything, Dad.
Honest.
She thinks maybe you're having nightmares again.
And if you are and if you want to talk to someone about them, someone who doesn't share your DNA I'll I'll let you know.
Look, I hated high school.
I couldn't wait to get out.
It was hell for me.
I was a target more than once.
Shit.
I'm sorry, Dad.
But I survived.
And look at me now.
I'm a paragon of manhood.
With a fucking beautiful family.
Yeah.
You did all right.
What I'm saying I had things to hang on to.
I had chess club, I had Knowledge Bowl See, now you're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
Do you have something? Does anything bring you joy? Or just relief? Your mom and I would feel so much better if you had something if you took more of an interest in, you know school activities.
You know I was actually thinking of going to the basketball game tonight believe it or not.
I have, uh a friend playing.
Maybe you think you deserve everything you get and more.
Maybe you're just used to hearing the cheers of the crowd.
Clay.
What are you doing here? It's a basketball game.
I'm here to show some school spirit.
That's great.
Great, Clay.
I'm glad you're, you know feeling better.
Hey.
How's it going? Everything's great, Marcus.
What the fuck are you doing here, dude? What's your play now? Hey, guys.
Can I get a picture? Nothing's going on, Tyler.
Just go away.
I seriously just wanted a picture for the yearbook.
If they knew the kind of pictures you really took! Hey.
These T-shirts look great.
Uh, I'm glad you approve, Mr.
Porter.
I appreciate all the hard work you guys put into it.
Mr.
Down would you get a picture of us for the yearbook? Yeah.
Yeah.
Clay, what are you doing? Get off the court.
Jensen, get off the fucking court.
What the hell, Jensen? Game's about to start.
Hey, you! Get off the court! Get off the court.
Go.
Hey, skinny kid, get the hell off the court.
Clay, you okay? Do you care? Where the hell's Jessica? She texted me.
She was babysitting her brothers and had to wait till her mom got home to leave.
Well, we can't wait for her.
Okay, ladies, let's go! Maybe you can't imagine what it feels like to be on the sidelines, Zach like most of us are.
You can't imagine why a little piece of paper could mean so much.
Um, everybody, before you leave, we've added an anonymous class discussion bag to the racks.
We're gonna check it every Friday and talk it over.
You got another bunny? I wish I would get one.
Still don't know who they're from? You got, like, six compliments today.
I got a cartoon and a campaign flyer from Courtney.
Yeah.
You do realize shilling for votes is not a compliment, Courtney.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Skye, but I'm proud of my efforts, and I wanted to share that with the class.
Hey, Clay.
Go away, Tyler.
You know, I get that a lot.
Especially lately.
But today I'm on official yearbook business.
Why are you even talking to me? Because I want to see what you're gonna do next.
You really messed Courtney up.
Not as much as you did to me.
Still the cemetery? That's cold.
Does everybody know about that? Everybody knows about everything.
They know about your nightmares.
They know you beat off to Hannah's picture.
And they know what you did to her.
What is it? What did I do? What? Clay? Heads up.
Jensen, come on, throw the damn ball.
Clay.
- Clay.
- Come on! Come on, what are you waiting for? Throw the ball, dipshit.
Jesus, Clay, what the fuck? Clay.
Clay.
- Clay.
- We got a game, man! Throw it in, loser! Thanks for making me do that.
Uh-uh.
No way.
You've been late to practice twice this week.
Now you miss most of first quarter? I'm sorry, I didn't know I was going to be so late.
Jess, look, you got a problem, come to me, we'll work it out.
But I'm sorry, you're out of today's game.
Yo, Jess.
You're not leaving, are you? I'm benched for the game.
Or didn't the entire gym just hear that? Well, if you're benched, take a seat.
- Make some room, you guys.
- I don't know.
Come on, you don't want to miss your boyfriend's big game.
And we're having fun up there.
Milady.
Maybe you don't know what it's like to need a lifeline, Zach.
The day after you insulted me in the cafeteria, my compliment bag was empty.
Not even a cute bunny.
By the end of the second week, I knew something was up.
Maybe I should have let it go, but I didn't.
I wrote you a letter.
I poured my heart out, opening up about personal things I hadn't had the courage to admit to anyone: How hard life was getting how lonely I felt and how those stupid compliments actually meant something to me.
And then I set my trap.
I was hoping once you read the letter, you'd get it, you'd realize how much I needed those silly things you were stealing from me.
But I guess I wasn't even worth a reaction.
Why me, Zach? Why me? Wow, that's double digits already.
Jeez.
Zach is on fire tonight.
Whoo! Zach! Zach! Zach! Zach! Zach! Zach! Oh-ho-ho-ho! Yeah! Stop it! Stop! Stop it! Stop playing! Stop the game! Stop! Stop it! Stop, stop! Is he crazy? Why me, Zach? Why me? Stickin' it to the man! Or, you know, one particular man who's rich enough and fucked-up enough to get his asshole son a $60,000 car.
Skye, what are you Are you at the game? God, no! Sculpture studio.
It's the only time I can get the welding rig away from the shop boys.
Were you at the game? I was.
But it was so bad, you had to leave before halftime? I can't I can't do this anymore.
This goddamn school, it's a terrible place.
You're just now coming to this realization? Where have you been for the past three years? Oh, that's right, pining after a pretty dead girl.
Why are you so mean? I thought we were friends.
Were.
We were friends.
What happened? I didn't understand it.
I still don't.
Yeah, well, welcome to the world.
Well, I hate it.
Me too.
I like this new angry, Audi-keying Clay.
He's got spunk.
I think I'm losing my shit.
Shit's overrated.
Lose it.
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
Not if no one knows you did it.
You won't tell? Please, why would I tell? I think it needs a question mark.
Oh, shit.
Halftime.
I should go.
I'll see you around? Seems likely.
Hey, Clay.
Stay angry.
I was feeling desperate, so I texted someone I thought was a friend.
His Audi? You you don't fuck with another dude's car.
I know.
I know.
I just I listened to his tape.
And he just got away with everything.
And he scored, like, 30 points tonight.
You keyed his car 'cause he scored 30 points? No, because it's not fair, Tony.
It's not fucking fair.
Those tapes are messing me up.
- They're doing shit to my head.
- I get it.
I get it.
I don't think you do.
I do.
Believe me.
This is all so easy for you.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Then tell me.
You seem like a tall vanilla latte.
I mean, for a drink.
Thanks.
I was just leaving.
Clay.
You're going to get through this.
I don't know if I will.
He's one intense dude.
He's just going through some shit.
Yeah, clearly.
And so are you.
Just tell me one thing: Tell me all this is not about a guy.
No, it's not.
It's about a girl.
I texted you, Jessica.
And you said you'd come.
And then you didn't.
Want me to clear these? No, I'm waiting for someone.
Clay? No, why? Just seen you around with him.
Not here.
No.
Not here.
I get it, Jess.
I gave you a ride home.
That didn't make us friends again.
So I guess I didn't have any friends at all anymore.
Clay! Wake up! You need to come downstairs.
Clay? Okay, coming.
Now, please.
Clay.
You remember Zach's mom, Mrs.
Dempsey.
She stopped by because something happened to Zach's car during the game last night and she wants to ask you if you know anything about it.
Okay, it's time to look at our anonymous class discussion bag and see what we have this week.
"Mrs.
Bradley has nice ankles.
" Well, I'm not sure that it's appropriate to objectify anyone in this way, and certainly not a teacher, but, uh, in so far as this was meant as a compliment, thank you.
They're real nice ankles, Mrs.
B.
MRS.
- Moving on.
"What if the only way not to feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all, forever?" Wow.
Okay, um This is serious.
This is someone who's in a great deal of pain.
Who would like to open our discussion? Any initial feelings? You had to know I wrote that note, Zach.
And you said nothing.
I think whoever wrote this is just looking for attention.
Or maybe it's, like, a call for help.
But then, why not sign their name? 'Cause it's anonymous.
Maybe it's just a joke, like someone's just fucking Sorry.
Messing with us.
- Something.
- That's idiotic.
It's not a joke.
How do you know, Skye? Because who would joke about that? Why don't you tell us, Skye.
You see what it was written on? Don't you work at Monet's? So? I don't have a monopoly over the napkins there, asshole.
Okay, okay, let's not call people out, all right? Whoever wrote it was in pain.
So what? They're in pain, I'm in pain.
High school's painful.
Get over it.
Okay, enough.
I think it was very brave of this person to tell us how they're feeling, and I want them to know that they are not alone.
There are lots of excellent resources for people struggling You let everyone think it was Skye.
Why didn't you speak up? I'm sorry, but what makes you think our son had anything to do with this? He was at the game, acting strangely.
The ref had to kick him off the court because he was trying to harass my son.
But nobody saw who keyed the car? Kids get jealous.
I'm asking you if anyone saw who keyed the car.
- I don't think he was jealous.
- You hush! Look, I came here as a courtesy.
I could have called the police.
- Well, maybe you should.
- Lainie.
No.
Maybe they should let the authorities figure out who did this instead of coming here pointing fingers and accusing our son of vandalism.
I did it.
Just because our son doesn't drive an expensive car - That's not the point here.
- I did it! I did it, okay? Karen, Zach, why don't you come inside, we'll sort this out.
I'd like to talk to Zach for a minute, if I could.
Absolutely not.
Mom, please? Two minutes.
Look, I I told her to forget about it.
I didn't want to come here or anything like that.
I'm glad you did.
Let's go inside and explain to your mom why I keyed your car.
No, Clay, please.
- Don't.
- Why not? Because.
Well, do your folks know? About you and Hannah? Why'd you do it? I didn't think that she'd react like that.
I mean, come on, Clay.
You knew her as well as anybody else.
That girl was too much.
You knew she needed help.
- When Mrs.
Bradley read that note - I freaked, okay? That letter.
That shit was heavy, and I didn't know what to do.
So you threw it away.
No.
No, I didn't.
Hannah lied about that.
Maybe that's what she saw, I don't know.
I freaked out.
But I never threw it away.
Holy shit.
Boys.
Coming.
I'm sorry, Clay.
I'll always be sorry.
Do you want to read it? I don't think I could.
I don't think I ever could.
See, I have this theory, Zach.
I have this theory that you're lonely too.
Could that be possible? What kind of lonely could the great Zach Dempsey possibly feel? Dempsey, what the fuck? We gonna take a long lunch or what? Uh, yeah, I don't know.
Come on, man, we need you.
More than that, we need your wheels.
I gotta go to bio, guys.
Why, so you can cry about a frog again, you fuckin' pussy? I didn't cry.
Fuck you, man.
Maybe that kind where you think no one truly sees you.
I know that kind of lonely.
Do you? "Why me?" Why why would Clay write that? Clearly, someone has singled him out somehow.
For what? Why would anyone possibly pick on a kid like that? He said something to me the other night.
He said, "What if I'm the bully?" That's not possible.
Are you sure? Clay.
Your mom and I talked, and in addition to paying for the damages to the car we do think there needs to be some kind of grounding situation.
Okay.
For at least two weeks.
Okay.
Okay.
Um I finished my half of this project.
I have to give these tapes to Tony by today.
Could someone drive me? So disappeared last night.
Yeah.
That game got sad.
Zach's good.
Whoo-hoo.
Who cares? We left early.
Who's "we"? Me and Bryce and some other guys.
You couldn't have texted me? Bryce said he texted you.
Yeah, he texted me to come over, not that you were there.
I mean, I texted you like four times.
You couldn't have hit me back? You are so not one to ask that, by the way.
I was in the hot tub, okay? I didn't have my phone.
What's the problem? You can live at Bryce's, but I can't hang out there? I don't live there now.
They're all yours.
I'm done.
Take 'em.
Share 'em.
Release 'em to the world.
I don't give a shit.
Really? You you don't give a shit? I can't I can't anymore.
I can't listen.
I can't hear it in her voice.
People are just mean, Tony.
They're messed up.
Zach didn't throw away the letter, you know that? No, I didn't know that.
He showed it to me.
Asked if I wanted to read it.
And I couldn't read it because it's starting to make sense to me why she did what she did.
I can help you through this.
Can you tell me why I'm on the tapes? You have to listen.
It's what Hannah wanted.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
What Hannah wanted.
What you're so sure of, but you won't say how.
Huh? Fine.
Forget you, then.
Let me help you.
What, like you've been helping me so far? No, thanks.
But look on the bright side you don't have to follow me anymore.
No one knows what's really going on in another person's life.
And you never know how what you do will affect someone else.
Hey, Bryce, what's up? Hey, Jensen.
And if that goes for me, it must go for everyone.
Even cheerleaders.
Hey, Sheri.
How was the rest of your weekend? Sorry, what? You were great at the game.
Jessica.
Hey, how are you? Hey, Clay.
Hey, Justin, good game the other night.
What the fuck is going on? Who knows anymore? Can I have your attention, please? Hey, it's Hannah.
Hannah Baker.
That's right.
Don't adjust your whatever device you're hearing this on.
It's me.
Live and in stereo.
No return engagements, no encore a huge congrats to our Tiger team for Saturday's win.
A special shout-out to Zach Dempsey, who crushed it with 28 points.
In other athletic news, the Lady Tigers won their game by a score of 54-32.
Thought you said this wasn't a test.
'Cause this looks like a test.
It's not, Mr.
Pratters, I assure you.
It is a character-building questionnaire that assesses personal strengths and weaknesses.
Excuse me, Mrs.
Bradley? Yes, Clay.
How important was it to you to help Hannah Baker? Extremely important to me, Clay.
Why do you ask? Remember that note you got in your bag last year? The one about not feeling anything anymore? It was from Hannah.
Okay, uh, why do you think that is? - Mrs.
Bradley? - Yes? Sorry to interrupt, but I need Mr.
Jensen.
Okay, Mr.
Porter.
Clay, we can continue this discussion at another time.
I have to say, I'm a little surprised.
What? Why? I know it's been a few weeks, but you seem like the type of kid to follow through on a promise.
Don't worry, Clay.
I almost forgot too.
Forgot what? Courtney and Clay, these are our new foreign exchange students joining us this semester.
This is Jhene, Fynn, Mahla and Deep.
Uh, Courtney and Clay will be helping you out.
They are on the Honor Board and they'll be giving you the tour.
The insider's tour! All the secrets that you need to know.
Okay, great.
So as you can see, it's one of the finest high school parking lots in the world.
Oh, and right here is the library, where you can find books and tables and chairs and all that stuff state-of-the-art computers, at least if the art was ten years ago and friendly librarians.
Not super bright always, but friendly.
Oh, wait, everyone.
It's Justin Foley and Zach Dempsey, star basketball players here at Liberty High.
Hey, Justin, where's my bike? Justin stole my bike.
What the fuck? What are you doing? I'm giving our new foreign exchange students a tour.
Figured they should know who owns the school, right, you guys? Clay.
Right, right.
Moving on.
Where were we? Right.
The auditorium.
Oh, oh, but before we go I want to show you something super cool.
- Okay? - Clay, cut it out.
Look at these lockers.
They all look alike, right? Not this one.
This one is special.
It belonged to a girl who killed herself.
Clay, come on.
You see all these "don't kill yourself" posters up on the wall? They weren't up before.
They put them up because she killed herself.
And why did she do it? Because the kids here treated her like shit! Jensen, that's enough.
But no one wants to admit it, so they paint over the bathrooms and put up a memorial, because that's the kind of school that this is.
Everyone is just so nice until they drive you to kill yourself.
And sooner or later, the truth will come out.
It's gonna come out.
Right, Tony? Right? You know the truth.
Clay.
I think you should come with me right now.
Get to class, everybody! All you, get to class.
Welcome to Liberty High.
Let's go.
Okay.
New game.

HANNAH: Some girls know all the lyrics to each other's songs.
They find harmonies in their laughter.
Their linked elbows echo in tune.
What if I can't hum on key? What if my melodies are the ones nobody hears? [BIRDS CHIRPING] CLAY: Whoo! -We're really freakin' high! -Don't think about it.
Just remember, you gotta go slow if you want to climb fast.
All right.
[SCREAMS] So, what happened out there in the hallway? SIGHS: I don't know.
Tired, I guess.
Tired? Tired of what? Just tired.
Seems like you were angry.
At this school.
About Hannah.
Aren't you? Sure.
Angry about another needless death.
I'm sad for Hannah and for all of us who who cared about her.
So, are you gonna punish me or what? Is that what you want me to do? Do you get a lot of kids coming in here asking for punishment? [MR.
PORTER CHUCKLES] What do you think your punishment should be? Isn't that your job? I mean, it's not like you're trained to be a shrink or anything, right? No.
But I like to think I can be helpful to kids who are hurting, not in touch with what they're feeling, lonely -I'm not lonely.
-Who may hurt themselves.
Not gonna hurt myself.
-Find their way out -You don't know what you're talking about.
Hey, screw you! Okay.
-I'm sorry.
-No, that's okay.
You're hurting.
And I want to help.
I want to be there for you, Clay.
I'm not going to say I understand just what you're going through, but if you talk to me I'll try.
Everybody wants to talk.
No one wants to do anything.
What is it that you want to do? I should get to class.
HANNAH: It all started because I was feeling lost.
I needed direction.
Any direction.
[INDISTINCT VOICES] You have to be kidding me.
Get in the car.
I have something I have to show you.
Tell me how you know what you know.
Tell me what I did to Hannah.
See you, Tony.
Actually, I hope I don't.
Ever.
[ENGINE STARTS] Clay, get in the car.
No.
What are you gonna do? You have no bike, buddy.
Why can't you leave me alone? Release the tapes.
Do whatever you have to do.
Just let me be.
I won't release them, if if you get in the car and come with me.
-Hi, I'm Kevin Porter.
-Hi.
HANNAH: And sometimes you take whatever way out you can find.
All right, just drive.
-Where are we going? -You'll see when we get there.
He's out of his fucking mind.
We played by Hannah's rules.
It's not fair if the tapes get out there because Clay went postal.
-He's not gonna go public.
-It feels like he might.
He's just sad, okay? Let him be Are you getting your stomach things again, Alex? -Come sit down a minute.
-What stomach things? He loved her, and she died.
Okay? He's going crazy.
Just give him a second.
He's not sad, okay? He's getting revenge.
It's not like we don't deserve it.
-[GASPS] -Alex, come sit down.
[DOOR OPENS] Dude, you're late.
I talked to Tony.
He says he'll take care of it.
What does that even mean exactly? -Tony's a dick.
-He's not a dick.
He's a dick, he's a prick, and he's a cock.
Okay, those are the same things.
No, they're nuances of meaning.
Right.
Yeah.
Look, Tony's not gonna do shit.
We have to take care of this.
End that little bastard once and for all.
That's insane.
I don't know.
What if we make it look like a suicide.
How tragic is that? I mean, two star-crossed lovers or some shit like that.
Grow up, Justin.
Are you really telling me to grow up, Little Mama's Boy? Yeah, I am.
[ALEX GRUNTS] Dude, go see a fuckin' doctor.
I've seen a dozen doctors, dude.
One thing.
If one thing had gone differently somewhere along the line maybe none of this would have happened.
It's right over there.
HANNAH: Dream big, they say.
Shoot for the stars.
Then they lock us away for 12 years and tell us where to sit, when to pee, and what to think.
MARCUS: Is it enough to get refs from the principal and vice-principal? Should I go to the superintendent? Our school doesn't weigh our GPA, so I only have a 4.
0.
Will this be a disadvantage? ZACH: Yo! You only have to maintain a C-minus average to play.
Look at the tits on this cheerleader! [BOTH LAUGH] Damn, didn't see that.
Then we turn 18, and even though we've never had an original thought, we have to make the most important decision of our lives.
Ready to begin your future? Don't think I have much of a choice in that one, really.
How's your financial aid? How's your GPA? Could be better.
PSAT? ACT? I haven't You haven't taken your PSAT yet? No.
Interesting.
Well, I can tell you that our financial aid tends to go to students at the top of their class, with SATs above the 90th percentile.
Great.
Thanks.
Of course.
And if you don't have the money and don't really have the grades, a lot of the decision gets made for you.
What future are you peddling? I'll let you take the first guess.
Hoarder? Close.
Librarian.
No way you're a librarian.
I know.
When people hear the term "librarian," they think 60-year-old white-haired woman with cankles.
We are rebranding.
No offense, but isn't it like a dying industry? You know, like travel agencies and cupcake stores? Let me guess, you own a Kindle.
Not in a million years.
No, I'm a paperback, write-in-the-margins kind of girl.
A kindred spirit.
So, uh, other than the Dewey Decimal System, what else has the library got going on? Well, I like to think we are a place where people can come together, find their tribe.
Do you write? You look like you write.
I don't.
I do, but I don't show anybody.
Ever.
We've got a safe space.
We keep secrets, and we have an all-you-can-eat cookie platter.
Well, thanks.
I probably won't see you there, but thanks.
Sure thing.
RYAN: Just take a brochure.
They have scholarships.
I don't need a brochure, don't need your scholarship, and I don't need four years of wasted time.
I have skills.
And a sweet Mustang.
Thank you.
CLAY: So, are you kidnapping me? TONY: Did you kidnap Courtney? I had a purpose.
So do I.
JESSICA: Alex.
Are you okay? Yeah, yeah.
Don't worry about it.
It's all this shit with the tapes, isn't it? If all that just went away, you'd be fine.
Yeah, but how does all that just go away? What the hell, Jess? You coming or not? In a minute.
I'm talking to Alex.
Oh, about what? About how much she misses me.
About how much better of a boyfriend I am than you.
How she wishes she never broke up with me.
-How you smell bad.
-Alex, come on! -Fuck you, Alex.
-What? It's totally true.
She was like, "Justin smells bad.
" I was like, "I know.
" I did not say that.
-You're a funny guy, Standall.
-No, you're funny, Justin.
With the "Let's end the little bastard"? What is that about? It's about protecting ourselves.
-From what? -From Hannah's lies.
But did she lie? 'Cause I'm really not sure.
'Cause she told the truth about me.
You know he's full of shit, right? -He's a fucking liar.
-He's not a liar.
He can be a pain in the ass, but he's a good person.
He's never lied to me.
Well, good for him.
HANNAH: I wanted a purpose a reason for being on this planet.
But that poetry group looked like an AA meeting.
Or a support group.
I saw no one within decades of my age.
Until I saw you.
You were the only other high school kid in the room.
Ryan Shaver, Liberty High's resident intellectual, editor of Lost and Found, general selfish snob.
[EXHALES] Welcome back, everybody.
Good to see our group growing a bit.
As usual, we begin by reminding everyone poetry is about honest expression.
And we all need to feel safe to share our deepest truths.
Nice to see a friendly face.
Friendly? Familiar? The sign-up sheet is making its way around.
Well, don't get used to it.
I think it's gonna be my first and last time if you're going to be here.
What? Why? Please only sign up for slots you'll actually use.
You put me in your little zine? Remember? "Best ass.
" That list was already going around.
Everyone was talking about it.
It was news.
It was wrong.
Now then, before we begin, Hannah, would you like to introduce yourself? Hi, I'm Hannah.
ALL: Hi, Hannah.
I don't know a lot about poetry, but I'm very happy to be here.
We're very happy to have you here.
Let's begin.
I believe Linda is first on the sign-up list.
O! A woman scorned Mother Earth O! All may feel your wrath Majesty of Mother Earth CLAY: Is this like your idea of some twisted version of wilderness therapy? Not a nature lover? I love nature, especially in pictures in books.
What's with the rope? No, seriously, this is getting messed up.
So what, are you gonna tie me up to a tree and force me to listen to the rest of the tapes? No, we're just going for a little walk.
How little is little? Just up that hill.
CLAY: No freaking way.
What the hell does this have to do with Hannah? Don't you want to find out? HANNAH: "O, tall mountains and Mother Earth" and all this other hooey.
I don't think I'm going back.
Well, I think it's fine if you don't want to, but maybe you should give it a chance.
You said you thought about a career as a writer.
Yeah, but no one has a career as a poet.
Damn it! If you could remind me to tell your father to call the alarm company.
I think this thing's broken.
Let me try.
You finish the deposit.
Well, how about uh what about a poetry teacher? Who would want to be a teacher? Kids are assholes.
Not all of them.
Okay, what about a journalist then? Do those still exist? Tell Dad this is broken.
You're a parent.
You're supposed to say things like, "Be practical, be a pharmacist.
" I will never say that to you.
You know, before we opened this store, your father, he used to travel all the time for these snooze-fest pharmaceutical conventions.
So, I would write him love stories.
Mm-hmm.
They were very, very dramatic and sexy.
Fifty shades of my mother? [LAUGHS] I thought they were pretty good, you know.
I don't know, I might have some of them.
-I could find them.
-Oh, God, Mom, please no.
Okay, listen to me.
I'm just saying allow yourself to dream a little.
I mean, hell, dream big.
About all the things that you could be.
Don't settle.
Mmm? [DOOR OPENS] -We're closed.
Go away.
-Hannah! Mom, he's not a customer.
Oh.
Oh, I see.
I'm gonna go get my coat.
Um It's in the back, so What do you want, Ryan? We're legitimately closed.
I have something for you.
A peace offering.
Take it.
Your thoughts deserve a decent place to live.
Come on, I know you're a journal girl.
Wow.
You do a really convincing imitation of a thinking, feeling human.
Hannah I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you feel embarrassed or humiliated.
I know what that's like.
You do? I'm a skinny faggot who writes poems.
I mean, please.
[CHUCKLES] I don't think you're supposed to use that word.
Mmm.
You're not.
I'm allowed.
Just come back to the library, Hannah.
Come back to the poetry.
Maybe.
I'll take maybe.
Thanks for the journal.
MR.
BAKER: Honey? Honey? You okay? I was just thinking it's a bad sign that we're running out of "Buy One, Get One Free" stickers.
We can look at it as a bad sign or we can consider it the world telling us we can never discount our way to Walplex prices.
I've got more stickers back here somewhere.
[DOOR OPENS] Oh, Olivia.
Olivia.
I'm so sorry I didn't come in sooner.
How are you holding up? Um We're managing.
You look great.
Oh, Olivia, Hannah was such a special girl.
Zach said so many nice things about her.
How is Zach? Well, he's just great.
Every college is looking at him for basketball, but he wants to be a marine biologist.
Can you believe it? A marine biologist.
A marine biologist.
MR.
PORTER: I wonder if you've been thinking about your future.
You know, your grades have been slipping a bit.
You started out the school year really strong but your grades have steadily dropped.
I would really focus on ending the school year strong if you have your eyes on a good four-year college.
I've been thinking about NYU or Columbia.
Wow, those are some highly competitive schools.
So, either you're going to have to make some changes next year, or maybe think smaller.
Maybe like a state school.
LAINIE: You never met with Hannah? Once, in the spring of her sophomore year last year.
We start the sophomores thinking of college.
And do you recall what she was thinking of college? I think if memory serves, she had some unrealistic goals.
And I tried to help her find some options.
Did you have a sense of how she felt about your interaction? She didn't say.
But did you have a sense? Mrs.
Jensen.
-Lainie.
-Lainie.
Please.
I know this is not the subject of our meeting, but do you know where your son is right now? I assume he's in class.
He isn't.
He walked out of school this morning and hasn't come back.
CLAY: I may be crazy, but I am not that crazy.
People free solo it all the time.
People who climb things, people who climb rocks which is a ridiculous thing to do if you aren't being chased by something.
It's for beginners.
I used to climb it with my brothers when we were kids.
Here.
Take this, clip it on.
It's chalk.
Put it on your hands, like this.
Or you'll slip.
What? Come on, are you a man or not? Not! Most definitely not.
I grant you that, no question.
I, uh I don't like heights.
TONY: It's an easy climb.
All the answers you seek are at the top of the cliff.
RYAN: The drag of your hand across my chest Sparks a blaze my lips cannot extinguish You, stubborn inferno You drive fast, and damn the red lights for slowing you down You see my veins shake at your first touch The power to move my blood on your own accord The definition of heart And after the stick shift jerk I beg my skin to do tricks Like forget how good it feels to lose control Between the burning house Of your hands [APPLAUSE] Whoo! Hey.
That was intense.
Um Thank you? Yes, thank you.
I want to write like you.
Seriously, can you teach me? Really? You make people feel the things you're feeling.
I want to be able to do that.
A couple of hours a couple of nights a week.
Chips and salsa on me.
"Stephie Moore is mean.
She" Sic.
"She so stupid.
" Third grade! I was in third grade! Don't get what my grade school diaries have to do with anything.
Well First, there's a bunch of gifted child drama I won't get into.
The main thing is, you have to tell the truth in poetry.
Your truth.
-But-- -No buts.
Ex nihilo nihil fit.
"Out of nothing comes nothing.
" I just don't like it when people read my things.
Every poem you write should be like someone reading your things.
It should be terrifying and incredibly embarrassing.
"How does Amber Holloway have boobs already?" You're an asshole! Yes! Yes! Be terrified.
[GRUNTS] Good.
Now try and slow your breath down.
How do I do that? By breathing slower.
What do I do about my heart, which is about to explode out of my chest? [CELL PHONE RINGS] Shit.
You brought your phone on a climb? No, I brought my phone on a walk.
That's my mom's ring.
Be a good son or plunge to the rocks below.
Yeah.
Thanks for the perspective.
[RINGING CONTINUES] HANNAH: It must be possible to swim in the ocean of the one you love without drowning.
It must be possible to swim without becoming water yourself.
I keep finding stones tied to my feet.
Sorry, I just Just keep going, keep going.
-Jess, I -What? -What? -I I-I can't right now.
No, no, it's okay.
Maybe if I helped a little? Oh, Jess, come on, look.
I just Maybe later.
I just don't want to right now.
I don't do it for you anymore.
-That's not it.
-It has to be.
You don't think I'm pretty anymore.
Jess.
God, no, Jess.
You're so beautiful.
What's happening to us? It'll all be fine, okay? Once these stupid fucking tapes are done.
Can we at least get high? -You don't even smoke.
-Yeah, I do.
Okay.
CLAY: We are really freaking high.
Don't think about it.
Chalk your hands if they're sweaty.
I can't really feel my arms.
You gotta shake 'em out, one at a time.
Get the blood moving, all right? [CLAY PANTING] Whoo! Good.
Good.
We're getting closer.
Remember, you gotta go slow if you want to climb fast.
All right.
-Oh, shit! -Ow! Gah! Shit! Oh, shit! What? What? I can't see! I lost a handhold.
Give me a sec, I've got to figure this out.
[BANGING AT DOOR] LAINIE: Clay! Clay, are you here? Lainie? He's not here.
He isn't here.
Okay.
Okay, calm down.
What's going on? I left you a detailed message.
The department secretary is 90.
He walked out of school and disappeared.
I'm sure he didn't disappear.
He is not answering his cell, Matt.
So he skipped school to play basketball or go for a ride.
He's missing, Matt! He's playing hooky.
He's not missing.
If you minimize this, I will lose it.
Okay, okay.
We'll find him.
He can't have gone far.
All right, I'm gonna throw this.
Grab it, pull yourself up.
-Tony, I can't.
-Of course you can.
One foot at a time.
Come on.
Oh -Whoa! Ah! Okay.
-All right, you got it.
There you go.
[LAUGHS] -There you go! -[GRUNTING] -[CLAY GASPS] -There you go! Oh, shit! Oh, man! Whoa! That was freaking amazing.
Was it? Or was it fucking amazing? That was fucking amazing.
Like I thought I was gonna die! But you didn't, did you? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Yeah.
I saw this YouTube video once where this guy in Spain was walking on this crane.
He had to be at least 15 stories.
He's walking, walking, walking.
And then he slips.
He lets out this loud scream.
Seconds later, wham! Wham what? The camera went black, but I'm pretty sure he died.
Shit, Clay.
Fuck.
I never totally realized, that's a really great word.
It is, huh? Uh You're bleeding.
Fuck.
HANNAH: Wow, this is scary.
[CHUCKLES] Today I am wearing lacy black underwear For the sole purpose of knowing I am wearing them And underneath that I am absolutely naked And I've got skin Miles and miles of skin I've got skin to cover all my thoughts like Saran Wrap That you can see through to what leftovers are inside from the night before And despite what you might think My skin is soft And smooth And easily scarred But that doesn't matter, right? You don't care about how soft my skin is You just want to hear about what my fingers do in the dark But what if all they do is crack open windows So I can see lightning through the clouds? What if all they crave is a jungle gym to climb For a taste of fresher air? CLAY: You promised me the secrets are at the top of this rock.
-I risked my life to get here.
-You wouldn't have died.
You'd break a bunch of shit.
[SCOFFS] I never thought about it.
Dying.
Until this year.
Have you ever seen a dead body? I've been to a few funerals.
Have you ever seen a crime scene? Well, like CSI and Law & Order, all that.
No, no.
Like a a real one.
Have you? Yeah.
Once.
What was that like? Quiet.
Not silent or anything, just no excitement.
No big noise.
Just cops walking around doing their jobs.
Like it was nothin'.
How old were you? Seventeen.
What was the crime? Suicide.
You were there.
You saw her.
You should publish this.
Oh, no.
No way.
This does not leave the safe space.
People need to see this.
It will change them.
No, they don't.
The whole point of creative expression is to hold up a mirror to the world so hopefully these god-awful people can start to see themselves and make connections to help them get through their dreary-ass lives.
Your pain your pain is important to other people.
HANNAH: But is that why you really did it? [STUDENTS LAUGHING] So you could help me touch just one person? What? I doubt it.
People like you don't make selfless moves.
Oh, my God, dude, this shit is crazy! "Today I am wearing lacy black underwear with the sole purpose of knowing that I am wearing it.
" -I wonder who's the skank who wrote this! -I don't even know what this means.
It's a bitch who's been burned, I know that.
You knew the shit I shared was personal.
You knew where it came from, and that it would get people talking.
I realize now I was desperate for someone to listen and you listened.
And then you made my most private thoughts a public spectacle.
[BELL RINGS] JESSICA: It's her writing.
I can totally recognize it.
COURTNEY: Why would she write something like this? So humiliating.
TEACHER: It has been brought to my attention that Ryan's publication now includes poetry.
And since we're doing sonnets this semester, and since you're all going to be distracted by it anyway, I thought we would take a minute to parse the work of this poet.
-COUGHS: Hannah.
-[CLASS CHUCKLING] TEACHER: There's a sort of naked vulnerability to it that I like.
It's quite intimate.
[ALL LAUGH] "Intimate" is not a dirty word.
"Today I am wearing lacy black underwear for the sole purpose of knowing" So you bear your heart to one person and everybody ends up laughing.
"I've got skin, miles and miles of skin.
I've got skin to cover all my thoughts like Saran Wrap.
" TONY: I can see her through the window.
She walks up to the door, she leaves this box.
And goes.
I didn't get up.
I figured if it was important, she would have knocked.
Rang the doorbell or something, right? And I I should have gone out there.
I should have talked to her.
But Look, I liked Hannah.
She was a friend.
But the girl was a lot.
She was drama.
And I was apparently the only guy at Liberty who didn't grab her ass or stare at her tits.
And so I always got to hear about it and on that particular day, I didn't want to deal, so I let her walk away.
Jesus, Tony.
Half hour forty-five minutes later, I get the box, open 'em, and there's these tapes, and a letter.
"Please take care of these.
Listen, and you'll know how.
" I started listening to the first tape.
And then I try calling the Bakers.
They don't answer.
I speed to her house.
The ambulance is already there.
And the cops.
And the front door's open.
I run inside.
Her parents are there.
And she's They've got her in a body bag.
I remember thinking, "There's no handles on that bag.
How are they gonna pick her up? How are they gonna carry her?" And they just grabbed the bag and threw her in the ambulance.
Just like that.
[CLAY SNIFFLING] Do the other kids know? Why you're taking care of Hannah like you are? Of course not.
You needed to know.
You're my friend.
What the hell, Ryan? Hannah.
What's so secret you couldn't speak to me at school? You know damn well.
How could you do that to me? The poem? I did you a favor, Hannah.
You're a beautiful poet.
Your work deserved to be heard.
You're a self-serving, egotistical fuckwad.
[SCOFFS] One day you will look back on this and know that I was right.
What you wrote, you can't teach that.
You have to live it.
Well, it's my life, Ryan, it's not yours.
Get your own.
There was a path the whole time? We could have just walked up there? Yes.
But what's the fun in that? Everything you told me, you could have told me anywhere.
In Monet's the other night.
Would you have been ready to hear it? Yeah.
No.
I don't know.
I wish I had known, though.
Why you cared so much about Hannah.
I kept trying to figure it out.
I thought maybe I thought maybe you were in love with her.
Clay you know I'm gay, right? What? No, I didn't know that.
How was I supposed to know that? I thought everyone knew it.
I don't think everyone knows.
A lot of people know it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Did you think that I was, like just friends with Ryan? Well, yeah, I guess so.
You think I would be friends with a guy like Ryan.
Yeah, would think you would be 'cause apparently you went out.
They're different things.
Trust me.
So that guy Brad is he your boyfriend now? I hope he's still my boyfriend.
He's been pretty annoyed lately because I've been spending all my time with another guy.
You.
Oh.
Right.
You mean with the tapes and all, not in a romantic way.
Sure.
ALEX: Alex Standall.
S-T-A-N-D-A-L-L.
Yes.
It's filled.
Ready to go.
Okay, with this, you want to take one every night before bed, with water, with or without food.
This one can make you dizzy-- I know.
I've been taking it for a while now.
Oh.
We have this as new.
I used to go to Walplex.
I could have them send your history over, if you like.
Yeah, that'd be great, thank you.
-There you go.
-Thanks.
I, uh I was friends with Hannah.
You were? Yeah.
Um I'm really sorry about what happened.
Thank you, Alex.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Apparently your mom called my dad.
Oh, Jesus.
My mom.
I'll text her.
We do not need that particular hysterical phone call at this moment.
Maybe if you didn't keep all those secrets from her-- Oh, fuck you, with your secrets.
[ENGINE STARTS] Could I, uh Could I get those tapes back sometime? Sure thing.
So, what, was this your plan the whole time? Maybe I helped it along, but I knew sooner or later you'd want the tapes back.
-You knew? -Yeah.
You haven't heard yours yet.
It's delicious, but not another bite.
Thank you.
This was a good idea.
[GIRL GIGGLES] [CHUCKLES] Oh.
Honey, you can't do that.
I'm so sorry.
-Oh, no.
-She's totally fine.
He was due for a new hairstyle anyway.
What's your name? It's okay, sweetie.
You can tell her.
Sarah.
Sarah.
You're very cute, Sarah.
Say thank you, Sarah.
No.
Sarah.
That's not nice.
Oh, please, don't worry about it.
I have a daughter too.
No wonder you're such a pro.
How old is she? -Seventeen.
-Seventeen.
Yeah, it flies by.
Before you know it, she'll be applying for colleges.
Hannah's already looking.
Hannah's such a pretty name.
She wants to go to New York.
Good luck.
MOTHER: Let's go back to dinner.
LAINIE: It's a horrible story, Matt.
She was a beautiful sweet girl, and she's gone.
Of course, we're supposed to tear her apart.
Go after her reputation, her boyfriends, anything she's ever written or said.
So don't do it.
Don't go after her.
You always said that's why you did law.
If it didn't always serve justice, it could serve the truth.
Right? So find out the truth.
What if it hurts our son? I believe he'll survive.
[CAR APPROACHES] The traveler returns.
You think that Tony's a good influence? My sense of him is that he's a very good influence.
But that's not our concern at the moment, right? Nope.
I know.
I am on board.
[DOOR OPENS] I'm sorry.
I'm really.
Tony and I had to talk, and we lost track of time.
And I know this was really not like me, believe me.
And I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I must be in huge trouble.
LAINIE: No.
But next time, a text would be appreciated before you go, and not on the way home.
No, right, of course.
I couldn't reach my phone for a while.
But, yes.
And you can ground me for a month.
No groundings.
We're just glad you're alive.
Me too, Dad.
You didn't say much on the way home.
I wasn't sure what to say.
I didn't lie to that woman.
I'm still a mother.
And to not be the mother of a dead girl for a few minutes! Should we move? What? Should we move? Should we go somewhere and start new? And give up the store? I'll give up the store, give up the house, everything if I have you.
But you do.
You do have me.
Okay.
Good.
-[GLASS TIPS OVER] -Shit.
Damn it.
I thought you had poetry workshop tonight.
Didn't go.
Never going back.
And we need to move.
Four hundred and thirty a month, and that's before the false alarms, which they charge you for, even though it's their fault.
You should have told me you canceled.
I was on hold with them for an hour! You know we need to cut expenses.
We should have discussed it first.
We live in the safest town in America! -That is not the point.
-Honey, honey.
I'm just trying to make ends meet.
And I'm not? We're either in this together, or we are not.
We can't be penny wise and pound foolish.
Right now we can't afford to be penny foolish.
Okay.
I don't even know what that means, honestly.
MR.
BAKER: Means we're wasting money on things we don't need.
HANNAH: Sometimes the future doesn't unfold the way you think it will.
Shit happens, and people suck.
Maybe that's why I stopped writing and eventually started making tapes.
-Listen.
-Andy, no.
Some girls know all the lyrics to each other's songs.
They find harmonies in their laughter.
Their linked elbows echo in tune.
-What if I can't hum on key? -CLAY: "What if I can't hum on key? What if my melodies are the ones nobody hears?" Is everyone reading that stupid magazine? I'm kind of addicted to it.
-You never read it? -No.
Listen to this: "Some people can recognize a tree, a front yard, and know they've made it home.
" -That sounds like shit.
-You think so? I think it feels really real.
"How many circles can I walk in before I give up looking? How long before I'm lost for good? It must be possible to swim in the ocean of the one you love without drowning.
It must be possible to swim without becoming water yourself.
But I keep swallowing what I thought was air.
I keep finding stones tied to my feet.
" I mean, damn.
I wonder who wrote it.
I know, right? One dark human being, that's for sure.
I mean, I like her poem, I think, but I'm not sure I'd want to hang out with her.
Well duty calls.
[DOOR OPENS] Hi, Clay.
Hey, Mrs.
Baker.
I'm sorry to bother you at work.
I wanted to give you something.
It's from Hannah.
Well, it's not Hannah's, but there's a poem that she wrote.
It's really good.
I mean, even our English teacher said so.
Page seven.
It's her handwriting.
Yeah.
I know that now.
[SOFT MUSIC PLAYS] 

1 HANNAH: I've got a question for you, Justin.
Not the one you think.
Not yet.
- ("BYE BYE BYE" PLAYING) - What's the best part of high school? The great friends you make? The romance? - No.
- (BELL RINGS) We both know the best part of high school (CHEERING) is summer break.
It's the great reset button.
And after everything that happened to me sophomore year I couldn't wait to start fresh to tear the rest of the pages from my journal and forget it all.
After the great flood, all washed away I still stayed Except I didn't get very far.
At work, my usual partner in crime was spending the summer with his grandparents.
His temporary replacement was nice enough, but entirely too normal.
(GIRLS GIGGLING) And I couldn't escape my past.
No, we didn't make a switch.
You did.
- And you didn't discuss it with me! - Listen, listen! The way we do business is making good decisions HANNAH: I needed a change.
I needed to be someone new.
(ARGUMENT CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) Have you ever felt like that? I wasn't going to be invisible anymore.
I was going to start brand new.
(DOOR OPENS) I was going to cut away the past and leave it all behind.
I was going to work harder.
Be smarter.
And be stronger.
Because you can't change other people, but you can change yourself.
No, so now she's trying to punish me by giving all of my stunts to this 80-pound freshman.
Go ahead.
You really think that she can lift Melanie Opstad's fat ass into pyramid formation? She's fucking fat! Really, good luck! Your coach is such a bitch.
She's actually cool as long as people show up to practice.
- Oh! - JESSICA: All right.
It's cheerleading, it's not saving lives.
Anyone down for a little pick-me-up? Oh, shit.
(JESSICA CHUCKLES) Is this vodka? Since when do you drink at school? Since when do you ever turn down a drink? JESSICA: Mm-hmm.
Come on, Zachariah.
There's no strawberry.
Uh, nah, I got a test in bio.
Don't be a bitch, Justy.
There you go.
Thattaboy.
- This tastes like shit.
- It's smooth.
All right.
I gotta go copy my Spanish homework before the bell rings.
Adios, losers.
- See ya.
- See ya.
Ready? Hey, Jessica.
Jessica.
- I heard the tape about your party.
- Seriously? Haven't you figured it out? Those tapes are bullshit.
- I don't think they are.
- Move on.
- Tell me why.
- Move on.
No.
My God! Okay, fine.
Come here.
Seriously, Clay? Get over it.
It was you she was talking about, right? - Because if it was, I want to help, okay? - (SCOFFS) We need to do something about it.
Tell someone.
That night did not happen the way Hannah said.
Then how did it happen? I hooked up with my boyfriend.
(LAUGHS) - With Justin.
- Yeah.
With Justin.
Hannah said you were completely out of it.
She said things happened.
If something happened, I'd remember it.
We were both pretty drunk, so we basically just passed out after.
Justin told you that, or you remember? I remember.
Okay? So back off.
Man, Jensen, you just can't leave it alone, can you? Stay the fuck away from my girlfriend.
- Let's go.
- Who was it, Justin? Who did it? - Did what? - Fuck him.
Let's go.
Mind your own fucking business, you got it? - Come on.
I know.
- What the fuck is his problem? Mr.
Baker.
Okay, uh what can I do for you? You say the school had no idea my daughter was suicidal, but you published a poem in that school paper that says exactly what she was feeling.
Okay, hang on.
(CLOSES DOOR) Um This isn't a school-sanctioned publication.
This is one of the students' independent art projects.
It's distributed on campus.
Teachers were discussing this poem in class when they should have been getting help for the kid that wrote it.
Okay, to be fair, this was published anonymously.
Did anyone try to find out who wrote it? Or ask whoever it is that put it in there? Mr.
Baker, this doesn't seem to be talking about suicide.
Are you serious? She talks about drowning with stones tied to her feet.
She talks about being lost for good.
Mr.
Baker a lot of teens talk about being lost.
Well, God help them if they come to you.
Mr.
Baker.
MRS.
BRADLEY: Good morning, everyone.
I have your results from yesterday's personality questionnaire.
So let's see what we've got, shall we? - Excuse me, Mrs.
Bradley? - Yes, Clay.
Um, about what I said yesterday, about Hannah writing that note.
Well, I I wasn't trying to say it was your fault, and I wanted to apologize for being rude.
Well, that's very 'Cause people need to take responsibility for their actions and face the consequences, one way or another.
Okay.
Thank you, Clay.
Uh, so, let's get to the rest of these results.
(CLEARS THROAT) HANNAH: Hey, Helmet.
Sorry I'm late, on gum-scraping day of all days.
Hope you saved some good ones.
You snooze, you lose.
What? What are you staring at? Ah, nothing.
Nah, sorry.
I saved you a particularly gnarly piece with some hair in it.
Here I thought I was a flowers and chocolates kind of girl.
So, uh, are you going to that party tonight at Jessica Davis's house? Since when do you go to parties? Well, since Jeff told me I had to come.
He's assured me it will be the highlight of my high school career.
Why can't people swallow their gum, like when we were kids? - I never swallowed my gum.
- Of course you didn't.
The rest of us.
You know, the party could be the highlight of your high school career.
Yeah, I doubt it.
Nope, it's part of my fresh start.
No more parties, no more slacking off.
That's crazy.
Because this is the year I'm gonna start slacking off.
You gonna start riding your bike sans helmet? I am.
Gonna turn in a project late? Uh Maybe.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
But I might half-ass a paper now and again.
Whoa.
Careful there.
You should come.
It might be cool to actually hang out when we're not both covered in chewing gum.
Don't be an enabler.
I made a deal with myself.
I'll watch out for you.
One beer, max.
Home by midnight, even if I have to pedal you home on my bike.
SIGHS I don't think so.
("UNDER THE SPELL" PLAYING) HANNAH: Part of me knew I shouldn't go to Jessica's house that night.
But another part of me couldn't help but wonder what or who I might be missing out on.
Under your spell Under your spell Under your spell They're not gonna shut our power off because of one late payment.
I don't like it.
We have to find another way to save.
Well, maybe we can get Hannah to pitch in Hey, Mom.
Hey.
I almost didn't recognize you.
Reminds me when you were little, with those floppy pigtails.
Okay, so I'm gonna heat up some leftovers.
I'm not really hungry.
No? Actually, there's this back to school party at Jessica Davis's house tonight.
But I don't have to go if you don't want me to.
It's Saturday night.
Go have fun.
I do have homework I need to get done by Monday.
And I was gonna try and get ahead on the syllabus.
Oh, Hannah, go, don't go.
I don't know.
It's up to you.
I really think staying open later will help us stay competitive.
MR.
BAKER: It's not going to help at all.
We're not a Walplex.
We can't stay open HANNAH: So here I am, the brand-new me (PARENTS CONTINUE ARGUING) living the same old life.
Yo, Clay.
What's up? How you doing today? What do you want, Marcus? Did you and Tony talk yesterday? We sure did.
Okay, and you're just doing your own thing.
Oh, more than ever.
Okay.
Okay, look, I understand that you're going through your own process or whatever, but I'm worried about you, man.
I don't want to see you get hurt.
Yeah, I'm sure you don't.
Hey, I'm trying to protect you, okay? But I can't if you keep running your mouth.
I mean, what's your play here, anyway? My play? Like it's a game? Okay.
You threw rocks through Tyler's window.
What did you do for Jessica? This is the second tape where somebody committed a crime.
There's a criminal walking around our school.
- Wait a minute.
- Don't touch me.
Look, maybe Jessica's managed to convince herself nothing happened, but if she's not gonna do anything, I will.
Listen, no one knows if those tapes are telling the truth.
And Jessica said nothing happened.
No court of law's gonna listen to a case where I'll start with the school.
You don't know what the f You don't know what you're doing.
Okay? You haven't even listened to your own tape.
I'm telling you, the worst is yet to come.
Yo, Alex.
Hang back a second.
We need to talk about Clay.
Haven't we already talked about that? Is your stomach thing happening again? - Hey, I said hang back.
- Just leave him alone, okay? Hey, you're a part of this.
You're in it, even if you are the pussy Hannah said.
Fuck you.
You're calling me a pussy, after what you did, or didn't do? - Fuck you.
- Fuck you.
Cut it out! Whatever happens to us happens to you too.
If I kill myself, you die too? Guys.
Seriously.
God, what's with him now? Don't worry about it.
What did Clay say? He's freaking out about Jessica.
He says he's gonna do something, maybe here at school.
ZACH: If he tells Mr.
Porter, or Childs MARCUS: We're all fucked.
We have to get to them before he does.
HANNAH: I thought maybe starting over didn't have to mean cutting myself off completely.
Maybe I'd been hanging with the wrong people.
Maybe I could start over with the right person.
But if I'd have known what was going to happen, I never would have walked through that door.
Hey is everything okay? Clay listened to the tape about my party.
All that bullshit Hannah said.
Of course he believes it.
He said he wants to help me.
So, whatever Tony did didn't work.
Apparently not.
If Hannah had seen something, she would have told me, right? (LOCKER CLOSES) I mean, we both know she made all that stuff up.
Did she? Because that photo of her on the slide with Justin was real.
The "Hot or Not" list was real, so maybe the rest was too.
(GRUNTS) Jessica Justin is your boyfriend.
Who are you going to believe, him or a girl who was jealous because you were dating her ex? (KNOCKS) Hey.
Hey.
Hey, um, Justin said you might have a little herb on you? - What are you, 21 Jump Street? - (CHUCKLES) Since when do you smoke at school? It's for a friend.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Come to my house after school.
Nah, I kind of need it now.
I mean, I can hook you up with my guy here.
Come on, I can't buy on campus.
I'm the student body president.
I'm captain of the football team.
The rules are different for us, in many ways.
You know it.
Yeah.
Come on Fuck.
All right.
Come and see me after fifth.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You showed him the poem? (SCOFFS) Why on earth would you do that? He walked in here all self-righteous, telling me we needed counseling, as if we're delusional.
As if this whole lawsuit is a big waste of time.
It isn't, we're not, and I want people to know it.
It was our one piece of leverage, Andy! You showed him our hand! Hannah was crying out for help right under their noses.
And under ours, too.
Uh Andy, sweetie you don't win a chess match by giving away your strategy, honey.
I'm trying to fight back here! I thought that's what you wanted.
Not like this.
(DOOR OPENS) MR.
PORTER: Hey, Ryan, thanks for coming in.
I wanted to ask you a question about this poem.
Oh.
Do you remember where it came from? Someone slipped it into my locker last year.
- Hmm.
- Yeah, I thought it was well-written.
So you didn't actually find it on campus.
Isn't that the whole conceit of the magazine? Sometimes I get submissions anonymously.
Why are you asking me about this? It seems that Hannah Baker wrote it.
Oh, my God.
Now her folks aren't too happy it got passed out around campus.
I had no idea it was Hannah's.
Did you think maybe the person who wrote this was thinking about hurting themself? To be honest, this isn't the first submission I've received like this.
Teenage angst, you know? Perennially popular.
But just because you write something doesn't mean you're going to do it.
True.
But I'm afraid the administration can't allow you to publish Lost & Found anymore.
But I'm working on a memorial issue dedicated to Hannah Baker.
I get that.
But with her parents bringing a lawsuit, it's too sensitive right now.
That's unfair.
I built this magazine out of nothing.
It's the focal point of my college apps.
You may be asked to give testimony about this poem.
That could affect your college admission too.
I'm sorry.
Sucks to be held accountable.
Doesn't it? Excuse me? (DOOR OPENS) Hey.
Hey.
Marcus.
Hi, Mr.
Porter.
Um, you got a moment? Sure.
Do we have an appointment today? No, Mr.
Porter, but it's actually kind of urgent.
Um I'm really worried about Clay Jensen.
TEACHER: "I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.
When they approach me, they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination indeed, everything and anything except me.
" What's the message here? - What's the author trying to say? - (DOOR OPENS) What are you doing? Hiding my contraband.
They're doing a bag check, obviously.
What for? I don't know.
Drugs.
Guns.
Kiddy porn.
Okay, Vice Principal Childs needs to check everyone's backpacks.
Stay seated, hands on your desks.
Study the quotation, think about what it might mean.
Relax, I don't think you have what they're looking for.
This is a complete violation of our civil rights.
Do you have a warrant? We don't need a warrant on school property.
It's for safety.
They're tarot cards.
Want me to read your fortune? CHILDS: Okay, Mr.
Jensen.
You want to protest your civil rights? Here it is.
That's not mine.
I need you to come to the office with me.
We can talk there.
But that's not mine.
HANNAH: If I'd known what would happen what that night had in store I might never have walked through that door.
But parties have a weird magic.
They're like an alternate universe.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER) They can make you believe that maybe anything is possible.
Hannah Baker! There she is! ALL: Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! I like the hair.
Looking good.
Thank you.
Keg's out back.
Get on it.
Here you go.
Maybe you do fit in after all.
Oh, shit.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Well, well, well, look who decided to show up.
Fashionably late doesn't fly when it's your girlfriend's party.
(CHUCKLES) Maybe I can make it up to you.
Maybe, if you're lucky.
I had to stop somewhere on my way over because I realized what today was.
Um Saturday? The day my parents went to D.
C.
for some Air Force ceremony? The day of the first fucking party of junior year! (CHEERING) No, it's officially two months since we've been going out.
Oh, my God, you are such a girl! - Shall we commemorate the occasion? - Yes.
(PHONE CAMERA CLICKING) Nice.
You need a refill? Uh, no, I'm good.
But knock yourself out.
Bryce picked up a ton of stuff.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, you and Justin? Yeah, me and Justin.
Why? I mean, exactly.
Why? And, like, how? Summer school.
Do I need your permission? Do you remember what he did to me? You guys weren't even technically dating.
How is that even the point? Bryce is the one who sent the photo.
But Justin is the one who showed him.
I'm sorry.
Look Ancient history aside, just be careful, okay? You're so sweet, Hannah, but I'm fine.
I know what I'm doing.
HANNAH: But she didn't did she, Justin? She didn't know.
Ugh! I hate hard liquor.
Are you trying to corrupt me? JUSTIN: No, we're celebrating, remember? And people don't really change.
JESSICA: Oh, shit.
(LAUGHING) Welcome to your second tape, Justin Foley.
CHILDS: It's an automatic five-day suspension, Clay.
Sit down, please.
I already told you, it's not mine.
Somebody must've slipped it in my bag.
Do you have any idea who? Who told you to check my bag? Start with them.
Your classmates are concerned about you, and so are we.
- Concerned about me? - It's been a rough couple of weeks.
But after what happened yesterday with the exchange students, now this It's not mine! (PHONE RINGS) Principal Bolan, hello.
I understand.
Of course.
Got it.
Thank you.
Principal Bolan feels, given your spotless record and your role in the school community, that a three-day suspension will suffice, as long as you sign up for the drug deferral program at the police station.
I don't believe this.
You have no idea why this is happening.
Okay, tell me.
Why is this happening? Who told you to check my bag? Do you have something you want to tell us? Like who sold you the drugs? Forget it.
You already think I'm lying.
Look, I'm sorry, okay? About everything, all right? Can I go now? Please.
You can have a seat over there.
Your mom will pick you up shortly.
SKYE: Mr.
Ramos asked me to get more dry erasers for the white board.
They suspend you? Three days.
I told you they were doing a bag check.
Why didn't you hide it? (SCOFFS) SIGHS Anyway.
Didn't realize you were such a stoner, Clay.
I didn't realize you cared.
Excuse me.
Of course I don't.
Did you tell Zach I keyed his car? Seriously? You think I'm the type that would rat anyone out about anything? I don't know what kind of person anyone is anymore.
Yeah? What kind of person are you? CLAY: Are you more of a beer person or a beer person? Hmm Tough call.
Uh I'll take beer.
Excellent choice, madam.
Tonight, it is being served lukewarm in questionably clean cups and devoid of any flavor.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Delicious.
When I was saving your seat for you, I had to fight off not one but three drunk teenagers playing Suck and Blow.
Good work.
I hope you called their parents and notified the proper authorities.
Oh, definitely.
No fun on my watch.
Fun? At a party? I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Uh, you look really nice tonight, by the way.
Oh.
This? I just threw something on.
Well, you do, you look really good.
Wait, wait, wait, I want to play! (GIGGLING) Scoot over, Clay.
I don't think there's any room.
Whoa.
Are you guys playing? Uh, no.
So you guys just like to watch? Yeah, only from an anthropological point of view.
You know.
Observing the millennial teenager in its natural habitat.
Hey! You guys playing or what? BOTH: Yes! - (KIDS CHEERING, HOOTING) - Damn, Justin, get in there! Okay.
Personal space! - Love that personal space.
- Yeah.
Shit, I guess I lost! Yeah, you fucking lost.
- Yeah.
You good? Sorry.
- No, I'm fine.
Are you okay? - CLAY: Oh, great.
- (LAUGHING) HANNAH: That night, for the first time in a long time I didn't feel invisible.
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER) I mean, they get along fine.
It's just I don't know.
It seems like they're bored or something.
Like the only thing they even have in common anymore is me.
Parents always think we don't pick up on that stuff.
Like Not only do they not see me, they don't see me seeing them.
I'm never getting old.
Yeah, me neither.
I was nervous, 'cause I felt so good, and I didn't want to screw it up.
I was trying to act normal.
But I didn't really know how anymore.
Okay.
(DRY CHUCKLE) Yeah, this is getting ridiculous.
Come on, I could use a refill.
I think we could both use something a bit stronger? Sure.
Absolutely.
CLAY: Okay.
All set.
HANNAH: There are three stories to tell about that night.
I'll tell this one first.
How did I end up in that bedroom? That's another story.
But for now, Justin, you'd been with the same girl all night.
(LAUGHING) But I'm not gonna call her out by name.
Even though, if you were at that party, you already know.
JUSTIN: You're so hot.
I can't keep my eyes off of you! JESSICA: Or your hands.
(LAUGHS) I realized two things in that moment.
Number one, I was drunk.
JESSICA: Hang on.
Please.
And number two, so was this girl.
Are you okay? Yeah, I just You need some water? But I figured you'd just give up and leave her alone.
I just need to close my eyes for a second.
(JUSTIN CHUCKLES) At least, I hoped you would.
Well, come on, you don't want to mess around for a little while? I know what you're thinking.
Maybe if this girl hadn't had so much to drink, what happened next never would have happened.
But it was a party.
Everyone had too much to drink.
And besides, how can you blame someone for something that happens while they're unconscious? Mom? Look, I know you're mad right now and you have every right.
Honestly, Clay, I'm not mad at you.
I'm at a loss.
Look, Mom, will you take me to the police station before we go home, to sign up for that program? You have a week to sign up.
I know, I but I need to get it out of the way.
Please? SIGHS Get in.
(ENGINE STARTS) Thanks.
See you later.
- BOY: I can give you a ride.
- GIRL: Okay.
Sure.
Marijuana.
Seriously? - Are you out of your mind? - Okay, chill out.
We had to send Clay a message.
He was threatening to go to the school.
- Shit.
- Yeah.
So, me and Justin and Zach, we figure we gotta show him who's really in control around here.
He's already acting up.
How do you know this won't just piss him off more? At least we bought ourselves time, kept him from talking.
LAINIE: I'll wait right over here.
Mom Um Can I ask you a legal question? Like, uh Like a hypothetical? You want to ask me a legal question now? Really? I just If someone hurt someone but the victim won't come forward Clay, who's hurting you? No, it's not me.
It's a hypothetical.
Just - It's a hypothetical.
- All right.
Hurting them how? Let's say, uh an assault.
But there's no actual evidence, 'cause it happened a while ago.
This why you keyed the car? No, Mom.
Just listen, okay? Just listen.
All right? Let's just say that the one person who actually witnessed it isn't around anymore.
Like, if they moved away or something.
Could the person who did it still be prosecuted? To be honest, that sounds like a tough case to prosecute.
If the victim won't talk, the witness won't talk, there's no evidence to prove it There's basically no way to press charges.
Fuck.
Okay, you need to tell me what is going on right now.
Just forget it, Mom, it's It's pointless anyway.
We can go.
What about the police? Well, I am sorry.
You do not get to answer me with a shrug anymore.
You do not get to shut me out.
You are my son.
Do you hear me? Wait, wait, Mom, hey.
Hey, Mom, what are you doing? I need to find out what happened.
If I can't get you to talk, then I am going to find someone who can.
I'm trying to help you, but you are pissing me off.
Okay.
Okay.
I lied.
Um, I did know Hannah Baker.
We worked together all the time at the Crestmont.
We had classes together.
Uh She was my friend.
And I miss her really fucking bad.
Oh, honey.
I didn't know how empty it would feel.
There's this big part of the world that's just just gone, and everyone else just keeps moving forward.
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.
The worst part is, there's there's nothing I can do.
I can't save her, I can't I can't bring her back.
I'm I'm completely fucking useless.
No, you're not useless.
You don't know, you don't know.
I know that you're a good person with a big heart.
I know Hannah was very lucky to have you as a friend.
She wasn't, though.
She wasn't.
Clay, your question about the assault that have to do with Hannah? No.
Not really.
Even if a crime can't be prosecuted, it shouldn't stay a secret.
- Shh - Stop! Mom, I'm sorry, but I've got to go.
What? Clay, no.
I'm sorry, okay? I've got to go.
- I will be home later, I promise.
- Clay! JUSTIN: Are you okay? You need some water? No, I just I just need to close my eyes for a second.
You don't want to mess around a little bit? No.
BRYCE: There you are.
We're doing beer pong out back.
Come on, dude.
- JUSTIN: I'm fine.
- BRYCE: What? JUSTIN: I'm good.
BRYCE: You got someone in here? - JUSTIN: I'm sticking around for Jessica.
- BRYCE: Oh.
What happened? She's in there now? JUSTIN: I don't know.
Just (BANG) (BODY THUDS OUTSIDE) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) HANNAH: I had to do something.
I had to make him stop.
(DOOR OPENS) The fuck out of here, man! (THUDDING) (DOOR SLAMS, LOCKS) But I couldn't get my feet to move.
It was dark in there.
And the music was loud, but I saw his face.
And I recognized his voice as clear as day.
And so would all of you.
But this tape isn't about him.
It's about you and me, Justin.
You called him a friend.
- (DOOR SLAMS) - But your girlfriend needed you.
(RETCHING) (CRYING) I'm sorry.
That girl had two chances that night.
But we both let her down.
(MUSIC, CHATTER DOWNSTAIRS) How do I live with that? How do you, Justin? How does she live with what happened? Uh-uh.
Elijah, you know the rules.
Gotta wait for Daddy.
MAN: That's not my concern, Sergeant.
I want it on my desk first thing tomorrow.
I wouldn't let your father see you doing that at the table.
Hmm! Mmm! Something smells good.
I don't know how you do it, Noelle.
Well, I put a bunch of stuff in a crock-pot and I forget about it.
That's my secret.
(LAUGHS) Jessica.
How was practice today? Great.
Coach Loftin says I'm one of the best on the team.
She's giving me extra stunts to perform.
Ah, she's testing you.
Remember what I told you.
It's not enough to earn it once.
You gotta keep earning it day by day.
Yes, sir.
Elijah.
Did you get that grade on your spelling test? Yes, sir.
Let's say grace.
(PHONE CHIMES) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) (KNOCKING CONTINUES) He can't be prosecuted, okay? - What are you doing here? - I know it was Bryce.
All right? - Jesus.
- She said he was your friend.
All right, get in here.
You have to tell her.
- When the fuck will you give up? - I get it.
Trying to protect your friend, you lied to Jessica - and told her Hannah made it up.
- I did? I guess it's my word against Hannah's.
Exactly.
The one witness is dead, Bryce will get away with it and you can stop protecting him.
It's legal fact.
Did you talk to somebody? Tell me what the fuck you did.
Are you listening? I just told you, I can't go to the cops.
What do you want from me? Tell Jessica the truth about what happened to her that night.
She knows what happened.
- Go ask her.
- I did.
She repeated whatever lies you fed her.
But she knows something's up.
She's messed up.
She was drunk at school today.
- (OVEN DINGS) - She's fine.
She's fucked up.
And so are you.
Jessica deserves the truth, and she's never gonna believe it unless it comes from you.
BRYCE: There you are! SLURS: Hey, we're playing beer pong out back.
(LAUGHS) - Hey, dude.
- You want to go? No, dude, I'm all right.
I'm sticking around for Jessica.
- She's so wasted! - Oh, yeah? I'll bet you had some fun with her, didn't you? Let me see.
Dude.
She's my girlfriend.
Come on, she's, what, she's your summer hook-up.
What's mine is yours, right? Didn't happen the way Hannah said.
I've heard that before.
- Tell Jessica the truth.
- I already told her.
It's bullshit, and you know it.
We hooked up.
That's what happened.
She wanted it, and we hooked up.
There was no other guy.
There is no other story, you hear me? So whatever Hannah thought she saw, she lied about it on those tapes because she's a crazy drama queen who killed herself for attention.
I'm sorry, man, I know she was your friend.
And you were her first kiss.
So she said.
Whatever happened whatever Hannah thinks happened how does that help Jess now? What she needs, what we all need is for this to be done with.
How can she be done with this if she doesn't know what it is? Dude, come on.
Leave her alone, get off her.
- Get the fuck out of here! - Hey, hey! Dude, dude! You can get me suspended.
You can ruin my fucking life if you want to.
It won't change what you did.
And sooner or later, people are going to find out.
People are not gonna find out.
Why are you protecting Bryce? What does he have on you? I'm not protecting Bryce, you little fuck! God, I'm protecting Jessica! I care more about Jessica than I do about Hannah, than I do about you, than I do about anybody else.
All right? So just get the fuck out! I want my bike.
Your bike? Seriously? Yes, you fucking asshole, I want my bike.
It's out back, behind the building.
Go knock yourself out.
(DOOR SLAMS) (SIZZLING) (DOOR OPENS) - Hey.
- LAINIE: Hey.
Did you find him? I drove around for an hour since I called you.
Nothing.
Where could he be going? This point, who knows.
And the weed? Maybe we've been looking at the wrong warning signs.
Maybe we don't have a suicidal kid, we've got one with a drug problem.
I really don't think so.
I teach potheads.
I know what that looks like.
It's not Clay.
He's quite good at hiding things.
He said he didn't know her.
He said he didn't know her well.
Clearly, he knew her very well.
He is devastated.
He feels like he's responsible somehow.
SIGHS Was she his girlfriend? Did he do something to her? Jesus, Lainie what are you implying? I am defending a lawsuit brought by two parents whose daughter was so damaged by something that she took her own life.
What if our son was part of that? He's not capable of it.
How do you know? I know.
I have to give up the case.
I can't take it to trial.
To protect Clay? Or you and me? To protect all of us.
Quitting the case wouldn't even do that, would it? (THUNDER RUMBLING) (THUNDER CRASHES) - Where's Justin? - Shh, shh.
Shh.
Don't worry about him.
We're just having fun, okay? - What? - Take it easy.
(GROANS) What are you doing? (CRYING) Oh, my God! (TAPPING) Hey.
Hey.
Sorry I didn't didn't text you back.
Can I come in? Yeah.
We should probably talk, huh? (SOBS) (SAWING) Hey, Tony.
Tony! Yeah.
Your dad said I could come find you.
You okay? I just talked to Justin about Jessica.
Okay.
How did everyone how did you just listen to that, and, like, ignore it? I don't think anyone ignored it, Clay.
Why is everyone protecting Bryce? Why are you? I'm doing it for Hannah.
Fuck that, Tony! Fuck that! Jessica got raped! And Justin's got her brainwashed.
Everyone at school is covering it up.
- That is beyond fucked up! - You don't know the whole story yet.
What else do I need to know? You're brainwashed like the rest, but I'm not, okay? And I'm not gonna sit back and do nothing like you and everyone else, including Hannah.
You need to calm down.
She let everyone intimidate her over and over and over, until she just disappeared.
Well, not me, no.
I am not giving up.
- You're upset.
- Fucking right! Why aren't you? Why isn't everybody? Just take a breath, okay? Fuck you, Tony.
- Fuck you.
- What the fuck are you doing, Clay? Come on! Fuck you.
Fuck all of you.
Fuck.
Goddamn it! God! (CLAY BREATHES HEAVILY) What happens if the tapes get out? Let's say we try and get some justice for Jessica.
What then? It's his word against a dead girl's.
Open season on Hannah Baker all over again.
What if we got one person to tell the truth? - I mean, just one of them.
- All right, okay, I'll make you a deal.
Listen to the tapes, all of them.
And then we'll talk.
We'll do whatever we have to do.
And you'll help me? Always.

1 (HORN BLARING) (CRASH) HANNAH: Sometimes things just happen to you.
They just happen.
You can't help it.
But it's what you do next that counts.
Not what happens but what you decide to do about it.
MAN: Please, my wife.
I was on the phone with my wife.
Where's my phone? PARAMEDIC: Sir, stay calm.
We're gonna take care of you.
MAN: But I've got to call my wife.
Please.
(INAUDIBLE) ("24" PLAYING) If you start to learn how to rise I can go that high HANNAH: And I've made some very bad decisions in my life.
I can fill that time The cleanest war was won before - As you know.
- With open eyes and bad lies The cleanest war was won before With open eyes and bad lies Never gonna know If you ever go because Say that you love And you'll never know JESSICA: What is it? What are you thinking? Just that, uh it's been a while since we hung out at your place.
Yeah.
Since my party, right? Really? I guess I don't even remember.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Since the party.
That's a long time.
Could have come over any time.
Your dad hates me.
He does not.
He does.
Last summer he told me I was trouble, - and that I'd better toe the line.
- (LAUGHS) That's just a thing he says to guys.
You got it way easier than Alex.
With the hair.
So, he didn't like Alex either.
Well, he kind of did.
Only because he was all "yes, sir," "no, sir.
" Where are you going? Stay.
I gotta go, Jess.
Oh.
Come on, stay.
More cuddles.
Come on, it's cold tonight.
- You always warm me up.
- (CHUCKLES) How about you cuddle with widdle Justin? Little Justin! You won him for me.
Yeah, I remember.
Best boyfriend ever.
I'm so not.
You take care of me.
Get some sleep, all right? I will see you tomorrow.
You don't have to go out the window.
Sweet dreams, Jess.
Only sweet dreams.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER A STEREO) I told you there were more stories about the night of Jessica's party, so here it goes.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER) Clay! Hey, guys.
JEFF: Clay.
Dude, you're leaving? Uh, yeah, I kind of am.
Looked like shit was happening for you in there.
Did it? Didn't it? I don't know, man, I just I don't ever know anything.
That's why you got me, man.
I know.
Whatever happened in there (HEART BEATING) just give her a minute.
Then go back inside and just find her.
I'm going home.
Just hang with me for a while, man.
I'm going on a beer run soon.
- Come with me.
- You're driving? Coca-Cola, my friend.
Two beers, two hours ago.
I'm good.
No.
No.
Thanks, Jeff.
I'm gonna take a long walk home and consider the wreckage that is my life.
You're a funny dude, Clay.
So I've been told.
- See you Monday? - Yeah.
BOYS: Clay! See you guys.
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING OVER A STEREO) Yo, Sheri, you're blocking me in.
I've got to go for provisions.
Oh, shit.
Okay, I'll be right out.
I've got to get home anyways.
- I don't want to make you leave.
- No.
I'm staying at my dad's, which comes with a curfew.
- I'll get my keys and be right out.
- Thank you, ma'am.
HANNAH: I wanted to leave.
But where would I go? And how would I get there? I was too weak to walk.
Or just too weak to try.
And then an unlikely hero came my way.
Hey, you need a ride home? Is it that obvious? You don't look so good.
I mean, you always look good, but you don't look so good.
Look, I can give you a ride.
Um How much have you had to drink? Barely anything.
Okay, look, hold this.
All right, guys, excuse me, pathway for Sheri, please! Hoo-hoo! All right, ready? Here we go.
(ALL CHEER) See? Now, look, if I can do that, I can drive home.
Come on.
You got it? Now I wonder if we would have both been better off staying at the party.
Sheri, this one's for you.
No, I got it.
You sure you're okay? You don't want me to grab you a water or something? I'm good, thanks.
Watch your feet.
I was expecting a lot more action, you know? I mean, first party of the year.
Like, some shit to go down.
Bryce and Zach, every time they get together BRYCE: Take it easy.
We're just having fun, okay? We're just having fun.
What are you What are you doing? I kind of liked the music.
Did you like the music? Sheri.
What? I have to tell you What? Something happened tonight.
What happened? It's okay.
I mean, you can tell me.
I got wasted.
My parents are gonna kill me.
Not if you tell them that you're staying at my house tonight.
I like this plan.
Yeah, just sleep it off at my place, and your folks will never know.
My phone's dead.
Do you have a charger in here? Mi cell phone es su cell phone.
I'm pretty sure "cell phone" in Spanish (BRAKES SQUEAL) (GIRLS GASP) Are you okay? Yeah.
What was that? I don't know.
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God, look, I wasn't drunk.
I told you, I wasn't drunk.
I know, I know.
My dad's gonna kill me.
The car is fine.
But we need to call someone about the stop sign.
No.
We gotta go.
My dad will kill me if he finds out.
We need to call the police.
9-1-1? Oh, my God.
Look, no way.
Hannah, get in the car.
Sheri! When you do something wrong, you can't just like ignore it.
Hannah, get in the car.
I'll call when we get home.
No.
- Come on! - No! Sheri, come on.
Sheri! Oh, my Are you ser Sheri! HANNAH: I needed to find a working phone.
I wish I'd found it faster.
(BRAKES SQUEALING) (CRASH) I need help.
My phone's dead.
Chargers are right over there by the beef jerky.
No listen.
There's been an accident.
I need to make a call.
Sorry, we don't have a pay phone.
Give me your phone.
Give me your phone! Okay.
Okay.
- How long do you think - Shut up! Jesus.
(DIALING) (RINGING) OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency? I, uh I want to report an accident.
Where? At the corner of Tanglewood and Bay Street.
Yes, ma'am, got it.
It's gonna be okay.
We already have this call.
Units are responding to the scene.
- You got the call? - Yeah.
We have the call.
Who Was it a girl who called? I can't give you that information, ma'am.
We have units responding to the scene now.
Okay, good.
Good.
Is there anything else I can do for you? No, that's all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do you still want that charger? HANNAH: So, yeah, that's the terrible decision.
But it's not the whole story.
(VIDEO GAME NOISES) Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- One second, man.
Goddamn it! (SCOFFS) No I.
D.
, no beer.
I don't want to I need to ask you if you were working a few weeks ago.
The second Saturday of September.
I work every Saturday.
And I wonder why I'm still single.
Uh, yeah.
Listen, I need to There was a girl who came in to call 9-1-1.
I don't think so.
You don't remember a girl? She used to buy candy here all the time.
She borrowed your cell phone.
Maybe interrupted your game? Yeah, that girl.
- Short hair.
Super upset.
- Yes.
Yeah.
Do you remember what the call was about? I think it might have been, like, a traffic thing.
I can't remember.
Can you try? Mmm.
Sorry, man.
Might have been stoned.
- Thanks for your help.
- Anytime, my brother.
I'm not your brother, dude.
All he said is the district lawyers asked for a meeting this afternoon.
His guess is they want to offer a settlement.
- They want to make it go away.
- Well, of course, but we should hear them out, maybe consider it.
I'm not going to consider letting the school cover up - what they did to our daughter.
- Doesn't have to be a cover-up.
Dennis said settlements often include a statement, and remedial measures What good will those do? They might help the next kid.
We agreed that we were going to fight this (DOOR OPENS) Hi there.
Be right with you.
(SOFTLY) Until the end.
We can fight this until the end, until it bankrupts us, when there's no guarantees we'll win.
- We're not settling.
- I'm not saying we should.
I just think we have to think this through.
What if we lose this lawsuit? Then the school walks away without having to acknowledge they're wrong, without changing the way they do things.
(WHISPERS) We owe it to Hannah to Hannah, to fight this.
And we owe it to the next kid to make sure this doesn't happen again.
How can I help you? Seriously, dude, that's bullshit.
He got suspended for three days.
That shit goes on his record.
Yeah, I don't really care.
At least we shut him up.
They kept him out for three days.
I don't think we shut him up.
You guys want to take him on another ride? 'Cause that worked so well.
His credibility is shot.
No one's gonna believe anything he says.
Until he plays them the tape, or until Tony does.
Yeah, what happened there? I tried.
Tony wouldn't budge.
He's got the tapes hidden somewhere, and this medieval, self-flagellating moral code.
- We have to do this another way.
- It's back to Clay.
If he's talking to Jessica about her party, it may be too late.
Why are we defending Bryce? Can someone tell me? I mean, he's a rapist.
Jesus, keep your voice down.
I published a poem.
He's a rapist.
Stop using that word.
ALEX: Why? What other word would you use? If Hannah's telling the truth, but Jessica says she's not.
Really, Courtney? That's still your position? Hannah is lying? Come out, little girl.
Shut up, Ryan! Okay, guys, look Tapes go out, we all go down, no matter what we did or didn't do.
- Think people are gonna sort that out? - Maybe not, but maybe Bryce goes to jail.
Do you really think he would? Do you seriously think that would happen? Maybe we should find out.
I don't want to.
No.
We cannot let Clay pass on those tapes, period.
Or talk to Mr.
Porter, which is why I wanted to buy us more time.
You kept him away from Porter, but we don't know what he's gonna do on his day off.
What are we doing after practice today? Talking about practice.
(SHERI LAUGHS) Always cheer.
CLAY: Sheri.
Do you have a minute? I'll catch up with you.
- Okay.
- Bye, Sheri.
Aren't you suspended? Yeah, so could we go somewhere not in the courtyard to talk? I can't be late to first period.
I just have a couple questions.
(JUSTIN YELLS) All right, let's go.
- See you.
- See you.
Justy! Coming to my place later? I'm procuring fresh weed from that sophomore kid.
Nah, I can't.
I can't.
Well, I can.
No, dude, you can't.
You've got recruiters coming.
UCLA, Arizona.
But that's all the more reason to relax.
- You've been tense as hell.
- I'm fine.
Hey, baby.
Hope you're not letting these two corrupt you.
- Never.
- Good.
That's my job.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
Where are we going? It's a surprise.
No.
I've got to talk to the guys.
Can we do this after third period? We can't do this after third.
Hey, guys, do what? If Justin doesn't want to find out, I should show someone else.
Yeah, okay.
Okay, let's go.
Damn, man, give me a chance.
Really? SHERI: Are you gonna tell anyone? We have to tell somebody.
- We have to do something.
- But it's over now.
It's not over for his family.
They still think he was driving drunk.
He was driving drunk.
For all we know, it wasn't the sign that caused the problem.
You know that? Or you just want to believe it? This is why I didn't want you to listen to my tape.
I didn't You wanted to keep your secret.
No.
Because I didn't want you judging me for the worst thing I've ever done.
Other people, they know my secret.
But you're different.
- I'm going to the police station - Clay.
to register for a drug diversion program that I have to take because your friends got me suspended.
I didn't know anything about that.
I think it was terrible.
Do you? Why don't you stop it? What can I do? His family, the man he hurt they deserve to know how it really happened.
We don't know how it really happened! I mean, yes, the sign was down.
- But he was driving drunk.
- He wasn't drunk.
You know that? Or you want to believe it? I made the biggest mistake of my life.
And I'm trying to keep it from ruining my life.
Do you get that? (BELL RINGS) You should get to class.
I'm trying to make it better.
And I'm trying to make up for it.
Will you just meet me after school? Why? So that I can show you, before you go tell the world what I did.
Give me a chance to prove to you that I'm not like everyone else on the tapes.
Fine.
I'll come.
I'll text you the address.
Are you gonna be okay today? Yeah.
Fine.
(WHISTLE BLOWS) Hey.
You okay? Hey, Alex, I'm fine.
Can't believe this fucking school.
They're already putting up drunk driving posters.
Whatever.
Whatever? He was driving drunk.
It was stupid.
Yeah, but I mean, aren't you sad? More pissed off.
You know, I think you can be both.
I mean, like right now, maybe it's easier being mad at him than being sad.
That's cool.
But I also think that maybe someday you might feel worse if all you were today was mad, you know what I mean? No.
Sometimes you judge people I mean, we all do.
Sometimes you just live to regret it.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, no, I probably don't.
I usually don't, so - I'm sorry.
- No, it's cool.
You don't have to leave or anything.
PRINCIPAL OVER P.
A: It takes a tragedy like this one, unfortunately, to remind us how important it is to be safe to be sober and never drink and drive.
(HANNAH, CRYING) Clay? Can we Can we talk? About what? About what happened.
I need to tell you What are you crying about? You barely knew him.
No.
Clay, you don't understand.
I do understand.
Every drama has to be your drama, or it doesn't count.
Somehow this is all about you.
It's incredible.
- No, Clay! - Please, just don't, okay? (DOOR OPENS) Sheri.
Sheri, stop.
I don't want to talk about it.
It was our intersection.
The accident happened at the same intersection.
I said I don't want to talk about it.
I thought you called about the stop sign.
We don't know that's what caused it.
We don't know it didn't! - Hannah - Sheri, Jeff is You two okay? Yeah, we're okay, Mr.
Porter.
I mean, considering what happened.
All right.
Hannah, how are you holding up? I'll be okay.
Okay.
If anything changes and you need to talk, my door is open.
Keep your mouth shut.
You speak of this to anyone, and we both pay the price.
And it's probably best if we just stay away from each other.
HANNAH: I just needed to be alone.
This was starting to be more than I could live with.
Wait.
What about drama? No more drama.
All good.
(LAUGHS) No, drama class.
You're thinking about drama class? If they walk in during first period, it's going to be awkward, no? We'll tell them we're rehearsing a love scene.
They're theater nerds.
It would help them to know what actual sex looks like.
All right, we should go, we should go.
I should show my face in first period.
You're just scared we'll be caught.
No.
Yeah.
You are.
But if they can't see us, we can't be caught.
Come on.
Where's the fucking switch? Here's the switch.
- Hey, Jess, what the fuck? - (LAUGHING) Let's see who can break it first.
Like, break the light bulb? What are you, six? It's just a stupid light bulb.
What the fuck is wrong with you? When did you become such a pussy? Hey! - Hey, why are you acting crazy? - Why aren't you? Cut it the fuck out.
- Throw it back.
- Jess, stop.
Jess, what is happening with you? Nothing.
Nothing's happening, right? Fuck this.
I'm out.
Bye! (SHRIEKS) Shit.
Hey, I saw you talking to Clay.
What? How did you even see that? Long lenses.
Is he turning you in? - We shouldn't be talking about this.
- Is he turning you in? He didn't say.
You like Clay, don't you? Of course I do.
I always have.
I always liked him too.
He was always nice to me before.
Tyler, what do you want? Let's talk to him.
You and me.
The other kids want to bring him down, but we could talk to him.
He might listen to us.
Sheri, is this freak bothering you? - No.
- No, Monty, he's fine.
Just think about it, please.
- I gotta get to class.
- Wait, Sheri.
No, you leave her alone, freak.
Got it? Fucking leave her alone.
These are thousand dollar cameras.
I'll break 'em on your face.
Jesus, Montgomery, leave him alone.
- You want to go again? - Do you? Didn't you just get back from suspension? Fuck you, Alex.
No thanks, Monty, you're not man enough.
Okay.
I suppose you expect me to thank you.
Actually I'd like it if you never spoke to me again.
(TAPS) Jesus! Fuck! Jess! The fuck? You can't sneak up on a guy like that.
I didn't know that kid was a dealer.
Yeah, as a sideline.
My usual guy does house calls, but I gave my last bag to Marcus yesterday.
Is that bag for now or later? Shit.
So you're a stoner now too? What is it with the best and the brightest? Are you looking to have some fun, or what? Where's your boyfriend? Practice.
We can meet up with him after.
- Why aren't you at practice? - I'm still benched.
Seriously? That's fucked up.
This school is fucked up.
(CHUCKLES) Don't disagree.
So, are we gonna smoke or what? In the parking lot? Are you insane? Maybe a little.
We can go back to my place.
My folks won't be home for a few hours.
Or we can go back to mine.
Mine won't be home for a couple of days.
You're not gonna get me in trouble, are you, Jess? Maybe a little.
Maybe a little.
The district feels the settlement is in the best interest of both parties.
Then why isn't the district here? I think they felt this would be a preliminary discussion, and once we got to finalizing terms Which we won't.
The offer's an insult.
Two hundred thousand dollars for the loss of a child, for the suffering of her parents? We can all agree no amount of money can equal Hannah's life, but it is an attempt to further healing.
And to be frank, it's more than a public school district can afford.
That's not our concern.
They have insurance.
The district is self-insured.
Every dollar spent here comes out of the classroom.
You and I both know that's bullshit.
Tell them to fire a few administrators.
Starting with Gary Bolan.
I don't think that's within the scope of the agreement.
Let's start with the NDA.
- Standard.
- It's a non-starter.
I don't know how far we get without it.
You want to keep this quiet.
You want Hannah's story hidden away.
The district will continue its anti-bullying efforts and will commit to a suicide prevention program to be in place by the beginning of the following school year.
Why Why wasn't it in place already? There was a policy in place.
There will be a better one.
(SCOFFS) Well, that's nice.
We all want to ensure that this doesn't happen to another child, period.
The financial means of the district will affect its ability to assure that.
Well, that's cold thinking.
We all want a solution that's fair to everyone, Dennis.
(TOILET FLUSHES) I know your son.
- I'm sorry? - Clay.
He visited the house.
And the store.
He's the one who gave us the magazine.
I see.
We probably shouldn't be speaking He was close with Hannah.
Did you know that? He, um He told me that, yes.
He misses her very much.
That's nice.
He seems like a good kid.
He's a very good kid, yeah.
Tell me, how much is his life worth to you? Mrs.
Baker, we shouldn't be having this conversation.
Don't you think it's exactly the conversation that we should be having? My son is worth everything to me, as I'm sure Hannah is to you.
And if I lost him felt someone had taken him from me, I would pursue any remedy possible.
Yes.
But I don't know any amount of money would suffice.
Would you settle for, say two hundred thousand dollars? I think I would only settle for the truth whether I liked it or not.
What the hell? No way.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) (PANTING) Were you just on the phone with your husband? Who are you? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
My name is Clay.
Well, what happened? Your husband was in an accident.
He's alive.
The paramedics said an officer would come tell you, but your husband wanted you to know right away, so I came.
Was anyone else hurt? - Yes.
- Oh, Lord.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) Yes? Hi, um Mrs.
Cantrell, I don't know if you remember me.
Clay, of course! From the night of the accident.
Of course! Sheri said a Clay would be dropping by.
What? Hey, look who's here! He knows Sheri, did you know that? Clay! Hello, how are you! Hi, Mr.
Cantrell.
Hey, Sheri.
Hey, Clay.
Let me help you to your chair.
I can do it.
I can do it.
I just love that you know each other.
Come on in.
She's our little angel.
What a small world! It really is.
The first time I came here, I tried to tell them.
I stood on the front porch and I just I couldn't get a word out.
I remember Miss Cantrell saying, "Well, don't just stand there, come in.
" The next time I stopped by, they invited me for dinner.
The next time after that, I helped hang pictures, and now I just spend time with them, help around the house.
They seem to like you.
Yeah, they're cute.
They remind me of my grandparents.
But they don't know the truth.
You didn't tell them about the accident.
What good would that do? Mrs.
Cantrell says he still has nightmares about it.
What about the other family? Look, I can't.
I I just I can't face them.
And what they might do? Look, I will tell them.
I will.
Someday.
You have to tell them now.
- Like, today.
- Why now? Why today? - Because every day hurts.
- How do you know? Every day they live not knowing the truth.
They need this, Sheri.
- They do, or you do? - They're hurting.
How do you know that? Did you go see them? That's not the point.
You can't keep this secret anymore.
It's my secret, not yours.
- Am I high? - What? I think I'm high.
Jess, you had two hits.
Two is a lot! Well, it's more than one.
What's in the safe? If my dad knew I can get into this, he would flip his shit.
Shit! I know, right? Dad's packing.
- This one's my favorite.
- Jesus.
Fuck.
Jess, is that thing loaded? Of course not.
Shit.
I guess it was loaded.
My bad.
(LAUGHS) You should not be handling a gun.
I know what I'm doing! This is a Glock 19.
Holds up to 15 rounds.
Single action.
Perfect for self-defense.
Cool, I'll take your word for it.
What, don't you like a Glock? I'm not really from a gun family, okay? We ski.
Try it.
I'm good.
Is there a KFC around, because I smell chicken.
Fuck you.
Take it.
Fine.
Yeah, so just like Only actors in Hollywood hold it that way.
Yeah.
Right.
Here, let me show you.
- Twist that.
- Mm-hmm.
Take this hand.
So, just relax.
Shoulders back.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Then you shoot.
(CLICK) Clay, we're just so glad to finally meet you.
Jeff was so fond of you.
You helped him so much with his grades.
It kept him playing ball, as a matter of fact.
Well, he did that himself.
I just, um helped him with punctuation and word choice and stuff like that.
You know, research techniques and Well, we sure are grateful.
You were a good friend to him.
How come we haven't met you before if you're such a good friend? Harris.
No, it's okay.
Um, I'm fine.
Thanks.
Jeff and I we were just friends at school, I guess.
But he was older than me, and on the baseball team and everything, and I wasn't really anybody.
Well you were to him.
Yeah.
He was really nice to me.
So, Clay, what brings you here? Well, I, uh I was hoping another friend of Jeff's would be here with me, but she, uh She couldn't come.
Okay.
There's something you should know about the night of the accident.
What about it? (PANTING) I was the first person to get there.
I was walking home and I heard the crash.
I found Jeff.
I found him.
Jeff! Oh, my God.
Jeff, can you hear me? Wait.
Hold on, Jeff, hold on! I thought maybe I'd try CPR.
Something.
I don't know.
- Come on! - (MAN MOANS) Hey, hold on.
Hold on one sec.
It was me.
I'm the one that called 9-1-1.
So, um So you were at the party with him? I was there.
I saw him just before he left.
And I I don't think he was drunk.
You don't? No.
He told me he wasn't, and I believed him.
I mean, until - (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) - (INDISTINCT SHOUT) Fucking beer everywhere.
It wasn't Jeff's fault.
The stop sign on the corner had been knocked down earlier in the night.
I don't know.
The cops thought it was Jeff's fault, I guess.
But it was already down.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
How do you know this about the stop sign? Did you knock it down? No.
No.
Then why are you apologizing? I-I I've been angry at Jeff since he died because he told me he was sober, and I thought he lied and did something stupid, and I hated him for leaving that way, and I was wrong.
I was wrong.
HANNAH: I walked by their house three times the week after Jeff died.
I even got their phone number and called.
And didn't leave a message.
I wanted to tell them.
I couldn't.
("ATMOSPHERE" PLAYING) Walk I know it was guilt I was feeling.
In silence And anger.
Don't walk away I think lots of anger.
In silence Anger at the whole fucking world and the way it works.
Danger Always danger Endless talking Of life rebuilding But mostly anger at myself.
For what I could have had, and never would.
That's terrible decision number two.
That's up next.
Don't walk away That's another sad and stupid story.
In silence There's so much wrong in the world.
There's so much hurt.
I couldn't take knowing I'd made it worse.
And I couldn't take knowing it would never get any better.
I thought you'd be here.
I think I will join you.
I found Jeff.
I was the first person at that accident, and I found him.
In his car.
Dead.
Jesus, Clay.
Why didn't Hannah tell anyone about the stop sign? Maybe she was afraid.
I was so pissed off at Jeff.
And at Hannah, for making it all her drama.
I didn't know.
Well, now you do.
And this just gets worse, right? You afraid? Yeah.
I'm gonna listen anyway.
Cool.
You don't have to hang with me.
I think maybe I should.
Why? Because it's your tape.
People like you have it easy Face like the sun Walking on air - I can't do it.
- You can't? After all this, you can't? No.
Jesus, Tony.
Death, and rape, and what the fuck is next? What did I do that Hannah thought was worse than that? Don't you know what happened? No, clearly, I don't.
So tell me.
You know I'm not going to do that.
Tell me this, then.
Tell me the truth, and I'll listen to the tape.
Did I kill Hannah? We all let her down.
That's not what I asked.
Did I kill Hannah Baker? No, she took her own life, Clay.
That was her choice.
But you, me, everyone on these tapes, we all let her down.
We didn't let her know that she had another choice.
Maybe we could have saved her, maybe not.
It's impossible to know.
Answer the fucking question.
Knowing what you know, believing what you believe, knowing me, knowing her, and what's on these tapes did I kill Hannah Baker? - ("THE STAND" PLAYING) - Come on down And meet your maker Yeah.
Come on down And make the s tand Oh, I have been out searching With a black book in my hand And I've looked between The lines that lie On the pages that I tread I met the walking dude, religious In his worn down cowboy boots He walked liked no man on earth I swear it had no name Had no name I swear it had no name Come on down And meet your maker Come on down and make the stand Come on down Come on down Come on down And make the stand As I crawled beneath the searchlights Looking through the floorboards Of this life I met Dr.

Come on down and meet your maker Come on down and make the stand Come on down Come on down 

1 HANNAH: I've told you about two of the worst decisions I ever made, and the damage left behind and the people who got hurt.
There is one more story to tell one more bad decision and this one's all on me.
No it wasn't the decision to go to the party.
Because how could I have known? But it was the same night.
That same awful night.
Remember that story I was saving for later? Well, this is it.
And it's all about you Clay.
How in the hell am I supposed to listen to this? I think the asshole answer is you put the headphones on, the cassette tape in, and you press play.
That is the asshole answer, isn't it? Yeah, but it's true.
I can't be here.
I can't listen here.
HANNAH: Go.
Yeah, you're going.
(LAUGHS) What are you doing? (SIGHS) I need you to drive.
- Where do you want to go? - Just anywhere.
Somewhere else.
HANNAH: Clay, I know you're asking yourself why you're on these tapes.
What could you possibly have done? What else could have happened the night of Jessica's party? Well, good luck with your fresh start.
Good luck to you, party animal.
I'm digging this role reversal, by the way.
Oh, yeah? You got this rebel with a cause thing going on.
Well that's me.
- Jeff's a good influence on you.
- You think? I mean, he got you to go to a party.
You've done that before.
I guess I have.
But not this time.
Part of me was saying, "Ask me again.
" Well, um happy homeworking.
Yeah.
Thanks.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am, this rebel is going to tear out into the night on his sweet ride.
- But part of me was saying, "Don't go.
" - CLAY: Onward! Not even for Clay.
I should have listened to that part of me.
See, I never told you, Clay, but I've always admired you.
You are who you are, and you don't care.
And I always cared what other people thought of me, as much as I acted like I didn't.
Is that a boy/girl thing, or a Clay/Hannah thing? (SNIFFS) LAINIE: Well, don't you look nice.
Off to the party? Uh, is that still okay? No, of course.
It just started drizzling.
You sure you don't want a ride? Of the few things in life I am sure of, that is one of them.
Can I get you your rain poncho? I'm gonna let you guess the answer.
- It's getting colder.
- I've got my hoodie.
Bye, Mom.
Be safe.
Call me if you need a ride! Don't do any hard drugs! Or any drugs.
Okay.
(SIGHS) (SNIFFS) HANNAH: I bet you also wish you'd never gone to Jessica's.
Right, Clay? (BELL RINGS) Clay! Is the party over? The party hasn't started.
No one's going to be here for another hour.
Oh.
But I thought I heard it started at seven? Yeah.
And, A, it's 6:55, and, B, seven really means nine.
Oh, right.
I'll come back.
No, no, stay.
You can help.
Do you know how to tap a keg? Every guy's like, let's get a keg, and when it's time to tap it I told you it was the wrong kind of tap.
I got this! Everybody settle! - I don't really know how to - Relax.
You can do snacks.
Got it.
Is there any special order that you want? Mixed? All in separate bowls? Certain things mixed? Make a choice, Clay.
Be bold.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER A STEREO) Dude.
You came.
What's up, Jeff? I've actually been here for awhile.
You've come a long way, Clay.
I think our work together you've made some real progress.
(SCOFFS) Right.
Thanks.
HANNAH: I bet you wish you hadn't invited me.
She coming? What? Who do you mean? Okay, man.
Hey, Clay.
Oh.
Hey, Alex, what's up? It's a party, so I'm pretending to have fun.
Yeah.
No, I'm actually here as part of my ongoing plan.
Gonna hang around Jessica enough that she gets annoyed and falls back in love with me.
I feel there's a logic flaw in that plan.
It's love, it's not logic.
(ALL CHANTING) Hannah! Hannah! Cool, Hannah came.
Now we can annoy Jessica together.
Uh, I have to leave.
JEFF: Hey, hey, hey.
Slow down, man, where you going? I just, I gotta get up really early.
Dude, Hannah's here.
She is? That's cool.
Hope she has a nice time.
You need to go in there and talk to her.
She's talking to someone else.
She's busy.
That's your cue, man.
That's your cue to cut in.
- Take a swing.
- A swing? You've got a fat slider in your sweet spot.
You've got to swing the bat through the strike zone and knock it out.
See, I'm aware those are baseball terms.
If I'm interpreting correctly, given my batting average, I would wind up with a strikeout and not a home run.
Very good use of an extended metaphor.
Oh, fuck me, Jensen! Get the hell in there, man! Now, okay? Now or I'm gonna kick your ass.
You'd never kick my ass.
Don't tempt me.
- How am I tempting you? - Go talk to her, man.
You're the reason she came.
I don't know that.
I think you do.
Go on.
Okay.
Going in.
Going in.
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES) HANNAH: I'd talked to you a million times before, but tonight was different, and I didn't know what to say to you.
But when you finally came up to me you knew just how to break the ice.
Hey.
Hey.
You're there on the couch.
So I am.
I mean, you you came after all.
I was feeling rebellious.
Ah.
So you finished your homework.
That would sort of be antithetical to the whole Right, right.
Yeah.
(LAUGHS) Uh, do you Do you want a drink? I believe you promised me a drink, in fact.
And a ride on your bike.
I did, didn't I? Which is a pretty big deal.
I don't let just anybody ride my bike.
Well, I look forward to it.
Yeah, me too.
I actually didn't ride my bike here, so we can't do that.
So, but I'll go get the drinks.
Yeah, I think I'm gonna come with you if it's cool.
Cool.
HANNAH: I was so nervous that night, but you made it seem so Easy? Is she kidding me? I was shitting myself.
Okay.
But she's not telling the truth about the way things happened.
She's telling her truth.
Why do you always act like you know? Because I do.
From the tapes, I know her truth.
So, why do you have to be here, knowing? 'Cause I don't know what your truth is.
And I don't know what's gonna happen when you find out hers.
(PHONE RINGS) Hey, Mom.
Hi, Clay, it's Mom.
Yeah, I just said that.
So you did.
Yeah.
Uh So how was day one of your suspension? Did you manage to be productive? Yeah, no, definitely.
I did some research.
Good.
Good.
Listen, you and your dad are on your own for dinner.
Something came up here.
Something with Hannah's case? I'll tell you later if I can.
Um There's leftover chicken in the fridge, and roast beef for sandwiches.
Lainie.
Gary Bolan returning your call.
Listen, I have to go, so be in touch with your dad, okay? - Sure.
- Bye.
Bye.
(DIALS PHONE) Gary? Hi.
Listen, the Bakers considered our offer to settle.
And they've turned it down.
They want to move forward with the trial.
What, um What happened? Was it the money? - Not enough? - No.
Lainie Jensen thinks it's this lawyer they got.
He's hungry.
Thinks they could win.
Based off of? - I mean, what do they have? - Hell if I know.
Have we found a smoking gun? School magazine.
The graffiti.
Yes.
Lainie's concerned that we painted over it, says it could be construed as destroying evidence.
Destroying evidence.
I'm not gonna let the school go down at the hands of whatever disturbed sophomore latched onto the term "Cum Dumpster.
" Okay? And I'm not gonna let them pin this on our staff or on you and Jane and me.
So you think that this is where they're headed? Apparently, they've expedited the subpoenas.
- For the kids? - For all of us.
You knew this was coming.
Yeah.
I mean, I suppose I hoped that it wouldn't get this far.
Those kids, they've been through a lot.
They're about to go through some more.
(DOOR OPENS) So, are there any dinner plans happening, or? Good idea.
Get me a beer.
If you're hungry, babe, I'll give you a twenty, you can go get us a pizza.
We could have an actual delivery boy come and bring it.
They cut my cell phone service off again.
The fuck.
Get your dirty ass feet off my notebook, man.
What, you mean this notebook? - Don't you ever touch me.
- Get out of my house.
- It's not your house.
- You think it's yours? - You pay rent? - Do you? Jesus, you're like two little boys.
Put your dicks away.
I want him out.
Either he goes or I go.
I'll get you a beer.
Don't fuck with me, kid.
Hey, it's me.
Uh Listen, I can't stay at my house tonight.
Just call me back, okay? Call me back.
BRYCE: Who's on the phone? Sheri.
Cheerleading bullshit.
What are we gonna do next? Hmm.
I don't know.
You tell me.
You're the woman with the taste for danger.
(CHEERING) Damn, Justin, get in there! - Oh! Uh - Okay, personal space! How's the hot tub at your place? Hot.
- And the beer is cold.
- (CHUCKLES) - Let's go.
- Yeah? HANNAH: So, let's start with the part of the party that I left out.
So, the idea is, you can have a super power, but it has a drawback.
For example, there's the triple take.
You can freeze time when you want for as long as you want, but once you unfreeze everyone else, you're frozen three times as long.
Okay, and you read this in a book? No, I made it up.
For those real life situations where you wish you had a super power to get you out of? If you had a super power, what would you want to use it for? Well, technically, I'm not really in a situation I want to get out of.
Well, what kind of situation are you in, then? I'm in a party situation.
And if you could use a super power right now, what would you want it to do? Uh I would make everyone else disappear.
And then what would we do? Um Well we would Oh! - Did he get you? - Mostly dry.
- Do you wanna maybe go - Say no more.
Um Let's - (BEER CAN HISSES) - Whoa.
Sure.
It's, uh, nice of Jeff to force you to come tonight.
No, he didn't force me.
He, uh strongly recommended it.
Didn't he also strongly recommend you come to the dance? No, I lost a bet.
- To Jeff? - (CHUCKLES) So the only time you and I actually ever get to hang out is because of Jeff? No, no.
I mean Maybe.
Kind of.
But it's strictly coincidental.
(BEER PONG BALL BOUNCES) If it's strictly coincidental, then why is he watching us? I mean, he does take an interest in my social life.
Uh-huh.
So you tutor him in academics, and he tutors you in Girls.
Girl.
Singular.
TROY: Hannah! Clay! Hey, Troy.
You two are gonna come over there and you're gonna play beer pong.
Uh Actually, I'm not really big into sports with balls.
All sports have balls.
Uh, no, actually, they don't.
Oh, they totally don't.
Troy, buddy! We're gonna leave these kids alone for the rest of the night.
And you're beer-ponging.
Whoo! Beer pong! Do you want to Yeah.
It's, like, easier to talk at work.
Except for all the people who want to watch a movie.
Or eat popcorn.
Very annoying.
- They should do that somewhere else.
- Don't you think? I'm thinking of starting a petition at change.
org.
I'm going to contact my Congressperson.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
The thing is, I think I'm gonna have to quit working at the Crestmont.
- Why? - My parents need me to work at the store.
Which kind of sucks, because I really like working at the Crestmont.
I do too.
What I mean is, I like working with you.
Well, if you work at your parents' store, you won't smell like burned popcorn.
Yeah.
(DOOR OPENS) (LAUGHING) Do you want to talk in there? CLAY: Stop.
- I've got to stop.
- You want me to stop the car? No.
Yes! No, no.
What does she say next? I mean, does she say what she did? Does she say why? She does.
So, Justin, Zach, Alex, they all heard this? And Ryan and Tyler? Of course.
Of course.
I'm just like everyone else.
MRS.
DEMPSEY: You have more points and more rebounds than Justin.
I don't know why you're not captain.
That's not how they choose captain, Mom.
I don't even want to be captain.
You're the best player.
- That's right.
- (TEXT ALERT) That's what matters.
Justin's just He's just going through some stuff.
He'll be back.
MAN: So, like you do, you go outside to work things out.
The bouncer gets in between us, and this kid pops him in the face.
- He did not.
Wow.
- Yeah.
So, my job's basically done.
I let the bouncer do his work, I go back inside to my beer.
Good job.
Alex got into something the other day.
Yeah, I saw that.
It was nothing.
It was stupid.
Didn't look like nothing.
I've got a family of brawlers, that's what I got here.
Trying to keep you two on the right side of the law.
(DOOR BELL RINGS) I'll get that.
Your mom's gonna be glad to see you.
Um hey? Look, I'm sorry to Can I Is it all right if I crash here tonight? Seriously? Yeah, I know, but Jessica, Zach they won't answer my texts, my calls, anything.
Why don't you stay at Bryce's? I think you know why.
Look, I can sleep in the garage.
No, man, that's weird.
You're not a hobo.
Your parents don't have to know.
I can climb to your window.
FATHER: Alex, who is it? Hey, Dad, it's um Justin.
Is it okay if he spends the night? We have some homework we have to do.
- Sure.
How you doing, Justin? - Good, sir.
Good.
How's the team this year? Uh, good.
I think we have a shot this year.
Excellent.
You eat dinner? Uh No, not yet.
Come on in.
We got leftovers, we got steak, we got all the fixings.
(SIGHS) Have you met Peter before? (KNOCKING AT DOOR) - Pam.
- (CHUCKLES) Working late.
You too.
Hey, I got Gary's e-mail about the Baker lawsuit.
We might be deposed? Yeah, the lawyers think it's likely.
Likely? Wow.
Are you concerned about something in particular? Listen, it might be nothing, but last year, at the end of the year, we had an anonymous note for me, for the class.
It didn't mention suicide specifically, but it was someone who was despondent.
Now I'm wondering if it was written by Hannah.
Do you have reason to believe it was? Clay Jensen said it was.
Clay Jensen? When did he say this? Just a few days ago.
He didn't say why he thought that way, but Did you ask him? I intended to, but he's out for three days.
Yeah.
We should see what we can find out when he gets back, or if you hear anything else from the other kids.
For the lawsuit? For the lawsuit, for the kids and, unless someone asks it might be best not to be sharing this.
(STAMMERS) Sure, you're right.
Yeah.
Let me know if you hear anything else.
Of course.
(TEXT ALERT) My wife.
I'm late again.
Hey, man, you could choke, so So, like, don't choke.
This steak is the shit.
- Your dad cooks? - My mom cooks.
My dad, he grills.
- It's so fucking good! - Yeah.
Where is your mom? She's at the hospital.
She does four days on, four off.
They're 12-hour shifts.
(PHONE RINGS) Jess, what took you so long? Seriously, Justin, now you're all concerned about what I'm doing? I'm sorry about today.
BRYCE: Is that Justy? Are you with Bryce? What the hell are you doing? JESSICA: We're hanging out at his place.
BRYCE: Tell him to get over here! Who else is there? Is anyone else there with you? JESSICA: Who are you, my dad? Come meet me at Alex's.
I gotta go, Justin.
Jess, do not hang up.
(LINE DISCONNECTS) Hey, what's going on? We need to go to Bryce's.
Can you drive? - I need to throw up.
- Okay.
- I don't have anything to throw up.
- You need some food.
- So I can throw it up? - So you can settle the fuck down.
My mother used to say: "Primero comemos, entonces lo demÃ¡s.
" That means, "first we eat, then we do everything else.
" I'll bet she's big on breakfast.
I've got a prosciutto mozzarella with red peppers.
Thank you.
And a plain turkey with a tiny dab of mayo, and an even tinier dab of mustard.
(TONY LAUGHS) Thank you.
No triple Americano for you? No, I'll just I'll just get some water or something.
Oh, my God.
Sit.
I'll get it.
Wow.
She doesn't do that for anybody.
I'm ready to keep listening.
We don't have to waste more time.
Eat your food.
- I can't.
- Don't act like a child.
Eat.
Stop talking like my grandpa.
You need to be in the right headspace.
How can I be in the right headspace to find out why I caused a girl to kill herself? Thank you.
Wow.
Rough night? - He's working through some shit.
- SKYE: I can see that.
He's got existential crisis written on his forehead.
I do not.
There's some truth you don't want to face.
Why did you say that? I see the future.
You know that.
I told you your fortune in 7th grade.
You predicted I wouldn't be 5' 2" forever.
How tall are you now? See? Ooh - La bruja.
- That's right.
I got my cards here, if you want a reading.
- I'm good.
- Maybe there's even a message from beyond.
What are you saying? Take a reading and you'll find out.
All right.
Seriously? Don't mock what you don't know.
I am Catholic.
I know all about this mystical bullshit.
First you shuffle.
CLAY: Is this so I know you're not cheating? There's no winning or losing.
You shuffle to transfer your energy to the cards.
Now cut the deck.
So, uh what do the cards say? This one, nine of wands, but it's reversed, which means you feel the world is against you.
- Really? - Seems right.
Like accusing people of ratting you out.
I didn't mean to The hermit.
Also reversed.
You're isolated.
Alone.
Big deal.
Everybody's alone.
A very un-Clay Jensen thing to say.
Ten of swords.
You keep falling back into the pain of the past.
You can't face your sadness, your fear.
You can't move on.
What the hell are you doing? - Page of cups.
- You're talking about Hannah.
The cards are showing someone struggling inside.
Tortured.
Emotionally.
Why are you so pissed at me? I'm just reading your cards.
I don't get how you're mad at me.
You stopped talking to me freshman year.
Really? First day of school, you didn't see me then turn the other way? Well I didn't know what to say.
How about, "Hey, Skye, how's it going?" You just you changed.
Yeah, so did you.
You used to be cool.
You used to be nice.
We can't all be nice girls like Sheri.
Or Hannah.
Why talk shit about Hannah? What did she do to you? - Besides ignore me? - You were jealous of her.
Why would I be jealous of a dead girl? What she did was stupid.
You don't know anything about it.
She didn't go through anything different than any of us.
- We all get through it.
- Yeah? Then what's that? It's what you do instead of killing yourself.
Suicide is for the weak.
CLAY: I mean, what a what a bitch! Wow.
Well, she is! I never heard you use that word before.
She doesn't know what was going on in Hannah's life.
You don't know what's going on in hers.
Would you you know, shut up, Tony? I get so sick of your little sayings, and things you point out, acting all wise.
You're like this unhelpful Yoda.
Is that a crack on my height? Whoa, whoa, hold on a minute.
Why? Headspace.
Headspace.
Unhelpful Yoda.
Unhelpful Yoda.
- Just let me out.
- I'm not gonna leave you alone.
I will let you get some air.
I know a place.
Shh Hey.
(WHISPERS) Kevin, where have you been? I've been texting and calling for hours.
I had the ringer off.
What's going on? You were supposed to relieve the sitter.
I had parent conferences today.
She left the house a mess.
First time in two hours this baby's stopped crying.
- I'm afraid to put him down.
- I'll take him.
- If he gets upset again - He won't.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
All right.
Okay, buddy.
(EXHALES) Is he teething? I don't know, but I've got drool all the way down my back.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about tonight, you know.
But the pressure is on me at school right now.
You need to find a balance.
Take some pressure off of you.
I could lose my job.
You're not gonna lose your job.
How do you know? Babe, you had no idea that girl was suffering.
You can't blame yourself for what she did.
What if I could? I know you can't.
Now I'll let you out.
(ENGINE STOPS) It's fine in here.
Okay.
I'll be right here if you need me.
CLAY: What? (LAUGHS) She has a rock collection from when she was little.
She used to water them and treat them as pets.
How do you know? We were friends at the beginning of last year.
It was fun while it lasted.
I didn't know you guys were friends.
She's so popular.
Yes, thank you, Clay.
Well, no, I mean No, it's I know what you mean.
Yeah, but she can actually be pretty cool and funny.
I mean, she still has her rocks.
Yes.
I guess an advantage of pet rocks is that they don't die.
Mmm.
Yeah.
They don't eat too much.
And they don't crap on the floor.
(LAUGHS) Oh, I'm killing her pets.
(LAUGHING) What's that one's name? I think we should name him Stone.
Is that his first name or last name? Both.
His name is Stone Stone.
- Stone Stone.
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Your name is Clay.
Yes.
(LAUGHS) - It is, and I've heard all the jokes.
- Really? All the jokes in the universe, ever? All of them.
That's impressive.
I like the name Clay.
I like the name Hannah.
("A 1000 TIMES" PLAYING) I had a dream that you were mine Iâve had that dream A thousand times HANNAH: At that moment everything was perfect.
And for the first time in a long time I could imagine a future where I was happy.
I left my room How good life could be.
I walked from noon Until the night I changed my crowd I ditched my tie I watched the sparks Fly off the fire HANNAH: And I know you felt it too.
I didn't even try Theyâd closed the shutters Theyâd pulled the blinds My eyes are red The streets are bright This okay? Yeah.
More than okay.
Were black and white The 10th of November The year's almost over I wanted you to do everything you were doing so I don't know why my mind took me everywhere else.
And I thought of every other guy.
MONTGOMERY: Did Justin finger you? I bet you went down on him.
Sometimes it's better to wait.
CLAY: I mean, you made the hot list.
They said you had the best MONTGOMERY: I hear you two like a guy between you.
Did Justin finger you? I bet you went down on him.
- HANNAH: And they all became you.
- CLAY: Sometimes it's better to wait.
Thought you were easy.
(VOICES CONTINUE, ECHOING) Stop it! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, just stop, okay? Did I hurt you? No, just don't.
I mean, what what happened? I thought it was okay.
- Hannah, I'm so sorry - Just leave me alone.
Okay, just leave me alone, Clay.
You should just go.
HANNAH: Part of me was saying "Please don't leave.
" Part of me never wanted to see you again.
- You all right? - I don't want you here.
Get out.
Hannah Get the fuck out! - (DOOR OPENS, SHUTS) - But you walked out the door like I told you to.
Why did you have to leave? It was the worst thing ever.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) (JESSICA LAUGHING) And then it got worse.
(LAUGHING CONTINUES) HANNAH: Clay Helmet your name does not belong on this list.
But you need to be here if I'm going to tell my story.
If I'm going to explain why I did what I did.
Because you aren't every other guy.
You're different.
You're good and kind and decent.
And I didn't deserve to be with someone like you.
No.
I never would.
I would have ruined you.
It wasn't you.
It was me and everything that's happened to me.
Goddamn it! - You knew.
- Whoa - You knew all along.
- Knew what? That all of this is my fault.
How did I know that? I-I just left Hannah.
I left her there.
She needed me, and I walked away.
You were doing what she told you to do.
No, I ran.
I was scared.
I thought it was something I had done or something I didn't understand, because I'm this fucking loser who doesn't know anything about girls - or about life or anything.
- So all of this is your fault? I left! I knew I shouldn't have left.
And then Bryce raped Jessica.
Hannah saw, then Sheri knocked down the stop sign, then Jeff died, and it all started with me! Clay.
I think you gotta get back from that edge.
Why? Why shouldn't I just jump, just let go? So you can die? - Reunite with Hannah forever? - Fuck you, Tony.
You think you could have changed anything? What does that make you? God? I should have stayed with Hannah.
She told you to go.
- I should've told her, should've said - What? You think you could have changed any of this? I could have said "I'm not going.
" She said, "Get the hell out of here.
" No.
No, I won't go.
- Get out.
- No.
TONY: Get the fuck out! Not until you tell me what's wrong.
- Not until you tell me what's wrong.
- Leave me alone! Okay, just leave me alone, Clay.
You should just go.
I thought it was okay.
I don't want you here.
Get out.
- Hannah - Get the fuck out! Okay.
I'll go.
But tell me what's going on, okay? Tell me what's wrong.
You don't want to be with me.
But I do.
- I really do.
- You know what people will say? No.
And I don't care.
Because it's easy for you, right? Because you're not the class slut.
- Don't say that.
- Everybody says it! - I don't say it.
- Yes, you did.
When you saw that picture! I didn't believe it.
I was angry for a minute because because I was jealous of Justin.
And I was mad at you for wanting him and not me.
And I was an asshole, and I'm sorry.
And I can never make it right, I can never say all this to you, but I love you.
And I will never hurt you.
Clay.
I'm not going.
Not now.
Not ever.
I love you, Hannah.
Why didn't you say this to me when I was alive? (SOBBING) I couldn't I couldn't tell her.
I couldn't hold her.
I killed Hannah Baker.
Like you said.
I said we all killed Hannah.
How am I supposed to live with that? Any way you can.
- JESSICA: Again and again! - Just take the money.
JESSICA: And fucking again.
What? Yeah, that's mine.
That's, like, twice.
JESSICA: This is embarrassing at this point.
BRYCE: You want to rub it in now? You finally win, once! - I am so fucking rich! - Whatever.
Justy! Alex! About fucking time, you guys.
BRYCE: These cards are getting stale.
Come on, sit down.
Jess and I had this thing planned.
- (SCOFFS) No, we don't.
- We were gonna get late dinner.
- Let's go.
- When did you tell me about dinner? Was that before or after you walked out on me today? Oh.
Justin, sounds like you'd better make it up to her by losing a few hands.
Come on, sit.
(COUGHS) All right, well, uh, the game is Texas Hold 'Em.
Five dollar ante, five dollar minimum bet.
BRYCE: Don't worry I got you staked.
Your girlfriend's been playing with my money all night anyway.
Alex, sit down.
No, I'm good.
I hate poker.
No, you have to play.
Everybody's playing.
Come on.
Here.
Whoa.
Jess, what the fuck? Your deal.
I don't want to fuckin' play cards.
I said your deal! Jess.
Shit.
Fuck it! Let's go.
- Jess, I said let's go.
Come on.
- What the fuck, Justin! Shit.
We're leaving now.
I don't want you hanging out here again.
Don't touch me like that! Don't you ever touch me like that! - Buddy, calm down.
- Stay the fuck away from her.
What is your problem, Justin? Guys, this does not need to happen.
Maybe it does.
What are you doing here? What are you doing here with him? We're just having fun.
Why the fuck are you here with Bryce? JESSICA: Why do you care? Tell me! - Tell her, Justin.
- Alex.
Let's go.
- Tell me why you care.
- Let's go.
Tell me why you fucking care! Because he fucking raped you! Justin, brother - I'm not your brother.
- Stop.
Enough.
I should kill you, you son of a bitch! I should fucking kill you! Let me fucking go! Let me fucking go! Let me fucking go! Stop.
I hate you.
What the fuck did you just do? You are the most beautiful woman in this family.
(ENGINE STOPS) You're not gonna do anything stupid tonight, are you? No.
Promise me? I promise.
(ENGINE STARTS) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Hey.
Hey.
You asked earlier about Hannah's case, but I couldn't talk.
The Bakers' lawyer got a judge to fast-track the case.
The school offered a settlement.
The Bakers turned it down today.
Things are going to be moving quickly from now on.
To trial? Bakers' lawyer will be issuing deposition subpoenas right away.
Got a copy of his list tonight.
A number of your classmates are on it.
So are you.
So I'll have to testify.
It's really just an interview.
And I'll prepare you.
Coach me on what to say? No.
Prepare you for what kind of questions they'll be asking.
Which will mostly have to do with your relationship with Hannah Baker.
And the more we know before the depo, the easier it will be.
Mom.
I promise I'll tell you everything but not yet.
("TALKING WITH STRANGERS" PLAYING) Today I talked to a semi-stranger A girl that I sorta know But every encounter - At the corner grocery - (TEXT ALERT) Holds potential for Our relationship to grow Half of my brain Was totally afraid That sheâd hate me Never want to see me again Half of my brain Was equally afraid That sheâd like me Want to be my friend I Am learning to love I Am learning to let Myself be loved How did I miss this lesson When I was young?

1 [water bubbling] - [panting] - [Bryce] We're just having fun.
[shaky breathing] [Bryce grunting] [echoing grunt] [water running] You still drinking coffee? You're still drinking coffee.
Yes.
I guess we just hope for more for our children.
We'll probably live longer, if that helps.
If your generation doesn't destroy the planet first.
It's too late, I'm afraid.
Clay, about the Baker trial Can we just have one morning without discussing that? The subpoenas go out today.
Who's getting one besides me? Sorry, Clay, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
The other day, you asked me if a person could be prosecuted if they hurt someone, but the victim couldn't come forward.
You said it was hypothetical, but you were talking about Hannah, weren't you? I wasn't, actually.
Because if something happened to her and you were involved in any way You think I hurt her? - Lainie.
- I don't.
If I did hurt her, and I admitted it, I could go to jail.
W-Well, this is a civil proceeding, not criminal.
But it is sworn testimony.
So if I lied, it's perjury.
[doorbell rings] Why would you need to lie? If I knocked down a stop sign and a kid got killed, is that manslaughter? Clay, what the hell are we talking about? I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
[knock on door] It's probably for me, don't you think? Morning.
Are you the parent or guardian of Clay Jensen? I just don't get why they're calling you to testify.
Did Hannah ever say anything to you about bullying or anything? What? No.
We were friendly, but we were never really that close.
They're probably just fishing.
Talking to every student who knew her.
It's probably nothing to worry about.
Just have to tell the truth, okay, and you'll be fine.
[Mrs.
Dempsey] I'm surprised at Andy and Olivia.
I'm sure they miss Anna.
Hannah.
Hannah, of course.
But this is a witch hunt.
I don't know.
They're wasting their time.
You didn't do anything.
You're not that kind of kid.
I know how kind you are.
I see you take care of your sister.
You're not going to jail, are you? He's not going to jail.
How well did you even know this girl? I asked her out once.
How many of these they got you doing today? I got another couple.
They got three of us out.
Something like this sure gets the community talking, huh? Sorry your kid's caught up in it.
I know.
Helluva thing.
Helluva thing.
Can you believe we moved here for peace of mind? They're still talking.
Jesus! Fucking Hannah! Yeah, fucking Hannah.
Fuck her for killing herself.
Dude, this is all gonna come out now.
Aren't you freaked? No.
I'm glad.
Seriously? [scoffs] We're all fucked now.
We were fucked anyway.
[line ringing] - Hey, it's Justin.
Leave a message.
- [beep] Hey, Justin, it's me.
Uh Bryce.
Listen, man, I don't know what happened last night.
I don't know what I did to set you off all of the sudden, and I just [chuckles] It's fucking killing me that you can't talk to me about it, so talk to me.
Okay? Please? I love you, man.
Call me.
[bell rings] - [teacher] Hey, Marcus.
- Hey, what's up? The secretaries are all talking.
They got Porter, Bolan and Child.
I talked to Ryan and Zach.
Yes to both.
It has to be Clay.
How else did they get our names? - He gave them the tapes.
- Could've been Hannah's phone, her texts.
We need to make a plan.
We need to stop texting.
Seriously, if they get our text records, we're done.
Oh, my God, I didn't even think about that.
Spread the word, we all need to meet in person.
Did you guys get subpoenas too? Shut up! Jesus, Tyler! What? It's public record now.
Everyone knows.
Nobody knows about anything.
You're gonna keep it that way.
I want in, on whatever you're doing.
I know more than anyone.
I know a lot more than is on those tapes, and I have proof.
Proof of what? What do you think? What have you done around here you don't want anyone to know? I take a lot of pictures.
Listen, you creep, you do not want to fuck with us! What we did to Clay was nothing.
Back off! And keep quiet.
Hey! Fuck you, man! - You fucking cut it out! - [Bryce] Guys, come on.
Whoa, Monty, come on, back off.
Get your fucking hands off me.
- You touch me again, I'll kill you.
- Jesus! Enough! - Hey, you okay? - No! The fuck, man? I'm sick of this shit.
Okay.
Jesus! What the hell, Justin? I'm sorry.
I needed to see you.
I'm gonna scream.
- I texted and I called.
- I'm gonna call the police.
Jess, please, I was trying to protect you.
Protect me? Seriously? I thought if you didn't know, if no one found out What? I'd be fine? I'd go about my life? You and I would get married and live happily ever after? That's what I wanted, was for us to to be together.
Forever.
You let him.
- You let him.
- No, I was drunk.
And I was scared.
- So was I.
- Bryce was at the - Don't say that name! - I'm sorry, it's just that Every time I was thrown out, when my mom was fucked up, one of her boyfriends was fucking with me he was there for me.
When I had no money, when I was starving, his folks bought my shit for school.
Okay, when my mom was busted for possession, he got his dad to bail her out.
They do that shit so they can own you.
No.
Okay? Last year, I couldn't afford new shoes for basketball.
I went through four pairs that season.
When we got to playoffs, they just had, like, holes.
Bryce didn't offer to buy me new shoes.
- He pretended he had an extra pair.
- Justin.
Are you seriously trying to make excuses for what you did? No.
I just want you to understand And I want you to understand what it's like to be raped.
But I truly hope you never will.
[doorbell rings] - Jess.
- No.
I'm gonna go get that, and you're gonna go back out the window.
[ringing continues] [sighs] [Hannah] Here we are.
Tape 12.
If you've listened this far and haven't heard your name, well, I bet you know exactly what's coming now.
Or maybe you don't have any idea.
Could that be true? Could a person be that sick? Let's find out.
But first we have to start at the beginning of the worst day of my life.
I guess I just thought that Mr.
Geris would be more understanding.
Apparently he's not.
This is a letter of intent to evict.
[Mrs.
Baker] Yes, I know.
I mean I don't know, maybe I can get on the phone and explain to him.
[Mr.
Baker] What's to explain? He wants money, we don't have it.
You can use my college savings.
- [sighs] Hannah.
- What? If we have money problems, I want to help.
These aren't your money problems, they're ours.
Use it now.
I can take out a loan.
And I can take a gap year.
I'd be fine with that.
Plenty of kids do it.
It's not the worst idea.
My brother took a year off.
He's a dentist.
Didn't hurt him.
Okay, I cannot even believe you're considering jeopardizing our daughter's future.
No! If it's my future, don't I get a say in it? No! That money stays in the bank.
I'm going to go over and talk to Mr.
Geris and convince him [sighs] to put us on a payment plan.
We have no leverage.
We have my fucking charm! Hard to resist.
Yeah.
- [laughter] - You're right.
It's worth a try.
Oh, shit, I was supposed to take the bank deposit in today.
It's due.
It's due this afternoon.
I can do it, if you need it done today.
That would be a big help.
Are you okay with Hannah making the deposit? I don't I don't see why not.
Do I look okay? Yes.
All right.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
- Love you.
- Love you, too.
- Go.
- I'm going.
Love you! Bye.
[cell phone chimes] [ringing] Um, hey, Helmet.
Yeah, I know, I just got your text.
Well, I I don't know I just called.
Oh, uh Actually, I can just come by and pick it up.
I'm running errands today anyway.
It's not a big deal.
Okay.
[engine starts] - Thanks.
- I could have mailed it.
I was going to the bank anyway.
And I wanted to come see you.
Why? Just to say hey.
Oh.
I mean, uh, haven't seen you in a while.
You see me at school.
Smells like someone burned the popcorn last night.
Yeah, it must have been the new girl.
Wow, that was quick.
They already found my replacement.
Well, there's no replacement for Hannah Baker.
Clay, I'm I'm really sorry about Jeff.
I heard his funeral was beautiful.
Sounds like the whole school was there.
Thought I might see you there.
My parents needed me to work.
[Hannah] I wanted to tell Clay everything.
How could I tell him anything anymore after that night at the party? I should go.
I got toilets to plunge.
Get the new girl to do it.
I lied.
I am the new girl.
Well, uh see you.
Yeah.
See you.
Oh, wait.
Uh I'm supposed to tell you to turn in your uniform.
Seriously, they really want that back? I know.
Oh, shit.
[breathing heavily] [engine starts] [tires screech] [bell dings] Morning.
Good morning.
- [sighs] - [register keys beeping] $7.
79.
- [coin clatters] - Whoops, sorry.
Do I know you? Not really.
[bell rings] I gotta tell you, the perfect disguise for Clay Jensen is not a hoodie.
Did you bring it? As requested.
I knew you'd have one.
Mind telling me why the switch? [sighs] I'm sorry.
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
We had a deal that we would do this together.
You said when I got to the end, we'll do what we have to do.
Are you at the end? Almost.
Are you going to pass them on? You and I both know Hannah wanted them to get to number 13, but if I give them to number 12, that's the end of it.
- Just give me a day.
I have a plan.
- Clay.
Do you trust me? Yeah.
Hi, Mr.
Porter, do you have a minute? Sure, sure, come in.
Have a seat.
What's going on, Sheri? I, um I heard about people getting these subpoenas today for court, and I [chuckles] I just I wanted to talk to you about Hannah Baker? Yeah.
Well, I I just I guess I don't really know anything about that.
I think the subpoenas today, they have me a little worried, that's all.
Hm.
Okay, listen.
If you get one, what matters most is that you just tell the truth.
Yeah.
Yeah, right, right.
Sheri.
And if you remember anything or hear anything, you come tell us first, okay? I will.
Thanks, Mr.
Porter.
- Shutterbug1337? - Yeah.
- You're late.
- Sorry, I had a thing.
You ready to do this? - It's all there? - Mm-hmm.
Jesus, not here.
- How do I know? - Just hold it.
That thing's got a kick.
All right? You gotta use the right grip.
Yeah, I'll Google that.
Thanks.
The first thing we need to do is find out what they know.
Or the first thing we need to do is tell the truth.
I'm with Alex.
I don't think it's as easy as you think.
What exactly is the truth? Profound, Marcus, truly profound.
And bullshit.
Oh, my God, how did you find us? - I deserve to be here.
- No, you don't.
Because you don't like me? 'Cause I embarrassed you? - I'm getting it worse than any of you.
- Let him stay.
How did you get to run this meeting, anyway? It's not the dance committee.
- I sit, or I start taking pictures.
- Sit down.
And calm down.
[Ryan] I think it's clear what they know.
Look around.
What do we all have in common? We don't know who got the subpoenas.
Sheri didn't.
Or she didn't get one yet.
I told her to come anyway.
Maybe she's hoping she'll avoid the whole thing.
Your dad must know something from the other deputies.
My dad's more of a "sweep it under the rug" kind of guy.
Works for me.
I don't think he gives a shit about you.
[ringing] [woman] 9-1-1.
How can I help you? Yes, hi.
I would like to report a Well, I would like to report something I did a few weeks ago.
[Courtney] If we don't get our stories straight before these depositions, it's bad for all of us.
[Alex] But what is the story exactly? [Courtney] Hannah was a liar.
She was jealous and needy and emotionally unstable.
She thought everyone was out to get her.
[Tyler] Aren't you describing yourself? [Courtney] We tried to be her friends.
We did.
She blamed us when things went wrong.
But she was the one with problems.
[Zach] That's the story? - [Courtney] Yeah.
- What would you say it is? It doesn't matter what I say it is.
'Cause there are three people who aren't here who are likely to say whatever they want.
Where are Jessica and Justin? They weren't at school.
Either of them.
What? Justin went to Bryce's last night.
He freaked because Jess was flirting with Bryce.
So he called Bryce a rapist, and told Jessica that everything on the tapes was true.
No fucking way.
[Zach] Monty and Jamie and a few other guys heard everything.
[Courtney] Wait, wait, wait.
They They heard? They know about the tapes? [Zach] Well, Justin didn't go into detail about the tapes, no, but they heard him call Bryce a rapist and that Hannah was telling the truth.
Good for Justin.
And Bryce is a rapist.
If you believe Hannah.
Seriously? You are the only girl here and that is the position you take? - Hannah lied.
We know this.
- [Ryan scoffs] I don't know it.
[Marcus] We can contain this.
We have to control the narrative.
[Ryan] You're deluded.
The narrative is, Jess knows Bryce raped her.
You guys would make shitty chess players.
We're two moves from being checkmated.
[Marcus] Not necessarily.
Not if we bring Bryce into it with us.
Bryce.
The rapist.
- Alleged rapist.
- Fuck off, Courtney.
Or we turn him in.
Bryce is dangerous.
I don't get why we're still protecting him.
- Thank you.
- [Marcus] We're not! We're protecting ourselves.
I applied early admit to Columbia, Zach's got scholarships.
Ryan, I know you've got big plans.
Courtney? Alex? I've got no plans.
I'm good to tell the truth.
Just 'cause Hannah fucked up her life doesn't mean she has to fuck up ours.
[Tyler] Hear me out.
If Clay gave the lawyers our names and Justin is running around saying everything on the tapes is true, then it's only a matter of time until we're all screwed.
- But if we can get ahead of it - What do you mean? What if we confirm Hannah's stories about Bryce? What if we give the school their scapegoat? They have someone to blame.
The Bakers have someone to charge with a crime.
Then whatever we did doesn't matter as much.
So you want to sacrifice Bryce to save your own ass? Yeah.
Of course.
The Bakers are broke, right, and Bryce's family has the money to make this all go away? Nothing we did compares to what he did.
- You're fucking joking, right? - Are you gonna defend Bryce? No, but aren't you? You've been doing it for weeks now.
Fuck you.
No, I haven't.
I just didn't want this to blow up.
Well, boom.
Justin let Bryce do it, then lied.
Justin will go to jail too.
Justin is my best friend.
You think he gives a shit about me right now? Don't you give a shit about him? What about Jessica? Doesn't she get a say? She should have answered when I called.
My God, Courtney.
You should fucking listen to yourself.
I can't imagine Jess won't want Bryce in jail for life.
Wanna know what's worse than being a rapist? Hiding behind one.
Fucking justifying a fucking rapist, that's worse.
You want to get the story straight? We all know the story.
Everything Hannah said on the tapes is true.
You're gay.
So what? Tyler, you're a stalker.
Ryan, you're an arrogant asshole.
Zach, you're just an entitled idiot who does cruel, stupid things even though you probably have a decent heart.
And Sheri's a fucking coward who got a kid killed.
- Alex, that's enough.
- No, Marcus.
You'll do anything to keep up your perfect reputation.
And, yeah, I'm a fucking weak, pathetic loser who ruined the one good thing that I ever had because I wanted a rapist to think I was just like him.
Hannah was my friend.
And we should tell the truth about her.
Because I know that if I had still been friends with her if any one of us had still been friends with her, she'd be alive.
So we tell the truth.
Truth doesn't just land on Bryce.
[Ryan] So let the truth land on us.
I published a poem.
A fucking good and meaningful poem.
I didn't mean tell the truth about everything.
[Zach] Why not, Tyler? You got more secrets you're trying to hide? You can do whatever you want.
No one's going to believe you.
People'll just laugh at you, like they always do.
They won't.
Hannah's truth is not my truth.
No way.
[Mrs.
Baker] I'm so sorry.
We should be getting more in stock soon.
[woman] I'll check back.
Tony, um thanks so much for coming in.
- Sorry I didn't come before school.
- It's okay.
This is my friend Brad.
Hi.
Hi, how are you? - Great.
- Uh, is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine, I just wanted to talk to you about something.
Wanted to show you something.
I'll do some shopping.
Here, uh I I found something in Hannah's closet, hidden away.
- Okay.
- I thought maybe you could help me understand what it means.
Wow.
Um Do you know or recognize any of these names? I I think they're kids at the school.
Yeah, I mean "Clay" I think is Clay Jensen.
And some of these other names I recognize from Hannah's phone and her Facebook page.
They're actually going to be subpoenaed for deposition.
The lawyer said the papers went out this morning.
Yeah, I heard that at school.
But why are they all connected, and why is "Bryce" circled so many times? And why why are you on there? I don't know.
Bullshit, Tony.
Look, you've been very, very kind to us but I don't think you're telling us the whole truth, and you need to.
Now.
Hannah had secrets, Mrs.
Baker.
Hannah's secrets are what killed her, and they do not get to stay that way.
Do you understand? I mean, clearly she was trying to work something out here.
There are names crossed out: Kat, Mrs.
Bradley, Mrs.
Antilly.
And you're on here.
Why do you think? I don't know.
Yours is the only name with a question mark.
Why? I don't know why my name is on that sheet.
[sighs] I think you do.
Well if you won't tell me, maybe you'll tell the lawyers.
You always introduce me as your friend.
You are my friend.
I'm your boyfriend.
Yeah, well, boyfriend is so Gay? That's not what I was going to say.
It's just Ryan always used to say, "This is Tony, my boyfriend.
" Like I was some sort of possession.
I get it.
But I'm not Ryan.
I know.
I'm not gonna judge you, but you have to tell me what's going on.
Or I can't be your friend or boyfriend or anything.
I had a friend.
Her name was Hannah.
She killed herself.
She left a job for me.
Secrets to keep.
I tried, I tried to honor her memory.
I tried to keep those secrets, but I don't think I did the right thing.
Her parents are hurting.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I just - I wanted to take care of Hannah.
- Come here.
[Mrs.
Baker] You lost it? [Mr.
Baker] Are you sure you didn't drop it? I looked everywhere.
I retraced my steps.
Someone must have taken it.
Generally that's what people do when they find a bag of cash laying on the street.
I'm so sorry, okay? [Mrs.
Baker] I just convinced the landlord to work with us to pay the back rent.
I don't know what to say.
I thought you were more responsible than this.
- We trusted you! - It's a few hundred dollars.
It's $743.
You can have my last check from the Crestmont.
I have $200 in the bank.
I can start babysitting on the weekend.
Hannah it's fine.
[Hannah] It seemed like no matter what I did, I kept letting people down.
[sighs] I started thinking how everyone's lives would be better without me.
And what does that feel like? It feels like nothing.
Like a deep, endless, always blank nothing.
And for those of you who will now be looking for signs everywhere - what does it really look like? - [Mrs.
Baker] Mmm.
Hey, Hannah, you still up? Yeah, I couldn't sleep.
Oh, honey.
[Hannah] Here's the scary thing.
I'm gonna take a walk.
[Mrs.
Baker] Okay.
Don't be out too late.
Take your jacket.
It's starting to get cold out.
[Hannah] It looks like nothing.
It wasn't a short walk.
I walked forever that night.
Through my old neighborhood, where the houses were nicer than the one we lived in now.
All the way up to the hill where the rich people live.
Where you live.
- And from blocks away, I heard it.
- [music and chatter] The music.
The murmur of voices.
The siren call of a party.
You'd think I'd know better than to follow that call after Jessica's party.
But my feet followed it.
My mind and heart were still in the big, blank nothing.
[doorbell rings] Jensen.
The fuck do you want? Hey, Bryce, um Listen, I was wondering if I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't mind Look, I know it's weird, but I was hoping to buy some weed.
It's kind of an emergency.
You want to buy some weed.
From me.
Yes, I do.
If you wouldn't mind.
Why would I mind? Come on in.
So you need some weed, huh? Yeah, um, I do.
'Cause you got yours confiscated the other day.
- You heard about that? - [laughs] Yeah, everybody did.
Any time one of the squeaky clean kids gets dirty, it's pretty big news.
That's interesting.
I'm gonna hook you up this time 'cause you seem desperate, and I happen to have shit on hand.
And, you know, 420 brotherhood.
But I'm not a dealer, okay? If you need a regular thing, I can hook you up with my guy.
You keep it on the coffee table? My parents are in Ibiza.
They won't be back for a week.
So, what do you want? Like, an eighth? Yeah? Indica or sativa? Um, hybrid.
Hybrid.
I concur.
Gotta say, man, I did not take you for a stoner.
Yeah, well I guess you never know what's going on in someone else's life, right? I bet you have some great parties out here, huh? [Bryce] Fuckin' legendary.
[pop music playing over speakers] - Hey, Hannah.
- Hey.
[girls shrieking] [Jessica] I am starving! Can you please grab me a slice of pizza? Hey, Hannah.
Hannah! Hannah Baker! Hey, Jess.
Can you do me a huge favor and grab me a slice of pepperoni? Sure.
[Zach] Hannah! Me too! Get me, like, two slices.
[Hannah] I was surprised to see Jessica at another party.
Hannah Baker's here to save the day! - Whoo! - Hannah! Hannah! [Hannah] Baker Pizza at your service.
Oh, my God, you are amazing.
[Hannah] But then, I was surprised to see myself at another party.
Yes, thank you, Hannah! You're gonna get grease in the water.
Think of it as a moisturizing spa treatment.
I read that pepperoni oil reduces cellulite.
I read that too, except it only works mixed with cheese.
And tomato sauce.
[both laugh] Have you been here all night? No, I just got here.
Oh, just when everyone's leaving.
I'm not going anywhere.
Yeah.
This party is far from over.
Hannah, don't just stand there, get in! I didn't bring a bathing suit.
So? Wear your underwear.
Everybody else is.
Just like a bikini.
Oh, my God, don't be such a pussy.
Get in! Whoa.
No, okay, okay.
Stop.
- Okay.
- Yes? [Zach] Whoo! [Hannah] And I can't explain it but sitting there under the stars I felt at peace for the first time in days.
[girl] Oh, my God, are they gonna do it right in here? [Zach] Nah, there's, like, eight rooms in that house.
[chuckles] Shit.
Sorry! - [laughter] - I'm so sorry, Hannah! [Hannah] No worries.
Oh Wait, are you guys leaving? - Don't worry, they're not going far.
- [giggles] [Clay] Yeah, looks like a great house for a party.
Oh, let me get my cash.
How much is it? Most people pay 60 bucks for an eighth.
I pay 40.
You know what, buddy, fuck it.
Just bring some to my next party.
We'll call it even.
Yeah.
Sure.
Hannah Baker told me about one of your parties.
Hannah Baker.
Sucks what happened to her.
Yeah.
[Bryce] She was such a beautiful girl.
[giggles] Hey, Zach, remind me which way to the bathroom.
Here, why don't I show you myself? - It's like a maze in there.
- Yeah.
[laughs] Thank you.
[jets turn off] I can't believe Hannah Baker finally came to one of my parties.
Well, it looks like it's almost over.
No, not at all.
This is the best time of night.
The drunks are all passed out, posers are gone.
Only the cool people are left.
And I qualify as "cool people"? Hell, yeah, you do.
Coolest chick in the junior class.
And the hottest.
Well, uh, I'd better get going.
My parents are probably super worried by now.
You just got here.
Sorry, I gotta go.
Don't go.
- We're just having fun.
- Bryce! [gasping] You and Hannah you had sex with her that night.
Did I? Yeah, I might have.
Did she want you to? [chuckles] I assume so.
Hannah and I Well, she was a very special girl.
We had a thing, off and on.
You raped her.
What? You fucking raped her.
Dude.
Don't talk about what you don't know about.
Why did you do it? Thank you for coming.
Get out of my house.
Not until you admit it.
- Seriously, Jensen.
- Say what you did.
- Say it.
- What business is it of yours? - She was my friend.
- She's dead.
- What does it matter? Say it.
- Calm the fuck down.
I need what I need, for you to admit what you did.
Here.
Right out there.
A week before she slit her wrists and died at home, you raped her.
She came to my party.
Mine.
She got in the hot tub with me, without a suit on.
Right? And she made eyes.
[chuckles] I know that's hard for you to hear, that your crush wasn't pure and clean.
But she fucking wanted it.
Now, why'd you have to do that? [grunts] [wheezing] All right, come on.
You're okay, you're okay.
Come here.
- [Bryce] No, no, no, no.
- [grunts] No.
[panting] [grunting] [groans] She wanted me.
Me.
She was practically begging me to fuck her.
If that's rape, then every girl at this school wants to be raped.
[gasps] [Hannah] The way I see it, there are two different kinds of death.
[Hannah groaning] If you're lucky, you live a long life and one day your body stops working and it's over.
Please, Bryce.
[Bryce] Just relax, just relax.
[groans] [Bryce whispers] We'll go nice and easy.
[Hannah] But if you're not lucky, you die a little bit [grunting and groaning] Yeah, that's good.
[Hannah] over and over [Bryce panting] until you realize it's too late.
[Bryce grunts] I know some of you might think there was more I could have done, or should have done.
But I'd lost control.
And in that moment, it felt like it felt like I was already dead.
[grunting] [laughs] Respect.
Jesus, Jensen.
Respect.
[sighs] So she wanted it.
She got in the hot tub with you.
And that means she wanted it.
Yeah.
She did.
But she didn't tell you so.
She didn't have to.
Girls play games.
She didn't say she wanted you to fuck her.
She never said no.
And that's not rape? Why do you care so much? I just need to hear you say it.
Jesus, Clay.
I mean are you a virgin? What does that matter? I'll take that as my answer.
Go get yourself laid a few times, or try.
And then come back to me, we'll talk like grownups.
Did you rape Hannah Baker? You wanna call it rape, call it rape.
Same difference.
[screams] Fuck! [panting] Fuck! Whoo! [chuckles] Jesus.
What the hell is this? - None of your business.
- It is my business.
I got commerce to do here, which does not work with the sheriff's department banging on my door, understand? No, I don't understand you, because that's not your fucking door! [choking] You are no fucking good for anybody, you hear me? [choking and gasping] You act like you're above it all but you're in deeper than anybody, it seems like.
No good for your mother, that girl of yours, not anybody.
- Seth.
- Back.
[Justin gagging] So, take your shit and go live with that rich buddy of yours.
Please, the woman next door will call the cops.
[coughing] We're done.
[coughs] Mom.
[sobbing] ["The Killing Moon" playing] Under blue moon I saw you [Hannah] I thought maybe I could forget about what had happened.
Up in your arms Too late to beg you or cancel it But thanks to you, Bryce It must be the killing time I'd finally lived up to my reputation.
Unwillingly mine And I knew there was no way I could ever live that down.
Up against your will But I thought at least maybe I could set the record straight.
So I started making a list trying to piece together just exactly how my life had gone so wrong.
And the names that came out.
Life is unpredictable and control is just an illusion.
In starlit nights I saw you So cruelly you kissed me Your lips a magic world Your sky all hung with jewels The killing moon Will come too soon [sobs] Fate Up against your will Through the thick and thin He will wait until You give yourself to him [Hannah] And sometimes all that unpredictability is overwhelming.
[Courtney] Dad, there's something you should know.
It's about Hannah.
It's about me and Hannah.
Okay.
Tell me.
[Hannah] And it makes us feel small and powerless.
Under blue moon I saw you - [phone vibrating] - So soon you'll take me Up in your arms Too late to beg you Who was it? No one.
I know it must be the killing time Unwillingly mine Fate Up against your will Through the thick and thin He will wait until You give yourself to him Room's looking good, kid.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah.
So, I was talking to a lawyer friend of mine about these depositions, and he seems to think we'll know more on Monday but he seems to think that, uh, we may be able to get you out of having to go.
And it's not that I don't have sympathy for these parents, kiddo, but you didn't have anything to do with this, and shouldn't have to be put through it.
Thank you, sir.
You're a good kid, Alex.
I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.
Good work.
Under blue moon I saw you So soon you'll take me Up in your arms Too late to beg you Or cancel it Though I know it must be The killing time Unwillingly mine [sirens passing] Fate Up against your will Through the thick and thin He will wait until You give yourself to him [song fades] Matt! Matt, wake up! Matt! - What? - [sighs] What is it? Clay's not here.
He never came home.
[sirens] Mercy One, Unit Three, to repeat: We're en route.
We've got a 17-year-old with a gunshot wound to the head.
Heart rate 120, respiration's 40, BP 90 over 60 and falling.
[Hannah] And once I took a look back and I finally understood how everything happened I decided that no one would ever hurt me again.
[soft music] 

One last try.
I'm giving life one last try.
Good morning, Mr.
Dempsey.
Morning.
My name is Dennis Vasquez, representing Andrew and Olivia Baker, and this is a deposition.
I'll be asking you questions, and you must answer them truthfully unless your attorney clearly instructs you otherwise.
- Do you understand? - Yes.
There's no judge present, but this is a formal legal proceeding.
You are under the same legal obligation to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
Do you understand? Yeah, I understand.
Okay, good.
Uh, for the record, please state your full name, your age, where you go to school, and what year you're in.
I'm, uh My name is Zachary Shan-Yung Dempsey.
I'm 17, and I'm a junior at Liberty High.
And when and where did you first meet Hannah Baker? I met her at a party, I guess, right before sophomore year started.
And how well did you know Hannah? Um I didn't know her that well at all.
I mean, I knew her from around school, I guess, and she, um she dated my friend Justin for a while.
Are you aware of anyone bullying Hannah? Dennis, we're going to object.
That asks him to qualify behavior.
Did you ever hear anyone say unkind things to Hannah? Um Yes.
Yeah, I heard, and, um and I said some things myself.
Hey.
There you go.
As requested.
And it just, like the tapes in my parents' store, it just records on them? Yeah, like a voice text on your iPhone, only with way more style.
May I ask what the project is? Just this stupid thing.
- Do you mind if I keep it for a few days? - Keep it as long as you like.
I'll see you in fifth? - Yeah, see you.
Thank you.
- Yeah.
I recorded 12 tapes.
I started with Justin.
Then Jessica.
Who each broke my heart.
- Hey.
It's Hannah.
Hannah Baker.
- Alex, Tyler, Courtney, Marcus, who each helped destroy my reputation.
Did you just? It's real tight.
On through Zach and Ryan who broke my spirit.
Through tape number 12 Bryce Walker who broke my soul.
But a funny thing happened as I finished number 12.
I felt something shift.
I had poured it all out and for a minute just a minute I felt like maybe I could beat this.
I decided to give life one more chance.
But this time, I was asking for help because I know I can't do it alone.
I know that now.
Good morning.
Good morning, sunshine.
- You look radiant today.
- I do not.
I need one more cassette for my project.
Is it okay if I just grab it? Yeah, go ahead, sweetie.
Anything you need.
Just put it down on the inventory, which no one bothers to look at - when they call the distributor anyway.
- I told you, they only allow for Of course, if you're listening to this, I failed.
Or he failed, and my fate is sealed.
Okay, Mom, I'm off.
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.
Hey.
When do we get to hear about this project? You don't.
It's stupid.
Don't even worry.
Nothing you do is stupid.
I mean it.
Okay, uh Mom, please.
No.
- I have to go.
- All right.
I love you.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
Thank you! Lorene will be here any minute.
She's good to work all day.
But are you sure you want to sit through these? Dennis says they're just mostly procedural at this point.
I'm sure.
We should both be there.
Someone has to meet the realtor at the house this afternoon.
We'll reschedule.
We have to get the house listed this month.
We'll reschedule.
I don't know it's necessary for us to be at every deposition.
I do.
Those kids hurt our daughter.
I want to find out what they know.
Hannah and me, we'd have a conversation now and then.
Did you ever date Hannah? No.
I mean, we had a milkshake once.
It was just a Dollar Valentine's thing.
Hannah didn't take it seriously? - Objection.
- I'll rephrase.
Um, did Hannah ever say anything to you that might lead you to believe that she did take it seriously? Not really.
I-I think I think I might have been I might have hurt Hannah's feelings a little bit.
But I didn't mean to.
Hurt her feelings how? I thought she wanted to date me.
She didn't.
Are you giving me the silent treatment, or is it the other way around? Shouldn't it be the other way around? - I'm just eating breakfast.
- You disappeared again.
There are consequences when you disappear.
I didn't disappear, for fuck's sake.
I was at a friend's house.
A friend who beat you senseless? I told you, I wiped out on my bike.
What, did you land on Mike Tyson? Look who just pulled up outside.
Tony.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Thought Tony might like to join us for breakfast.
We can all catch up.
Maybe talk about your depositions tomorrow.
- That would be great.
- Tony doesn't have time.
Upstairs.
Clay.
Mom, soon.
I promise.
Hey, what the fuck happened to your face? I'll show you.
This couldn't wait till after school? Copy this tape.
I'll get it from you after homeroom.
- I already have copies.
- No.
Remember how side "B" was blank? Yeah.
It's not blank anymore.
She wanted me.
Me.
She was practically begging me to fuck her.
If that's rape, then every girl at this school wants to be raped.
He fucking confessed.
No.
You didn't give him the tapes, did you? I gave him the gist of his.
I'm assuming you want to make a copy of that to keep your set complete.
And then what? Sheri texted me last night.
She went to the police herself.
- What happened? - I don't know.
But if she's facing up to it, and we have Bryce's confession What about going through the cycle like Hannah wanted? It's time we stop thinking about what Hannah wanted and start thinking about what she needs.
And Jessica.
And every other girl who "practically begged" Bryce to fuck her.
I gotta tell you, Clay, I am not sure that this is the right thing to do, and even if I was, I don't know where we stand.
We can't be righteous.
We've been sitting on evidence for weeks.
Either we do something now, or we give it up tomorrow in that deposition.
There are half a dozen kids going in there today.
Who knows what happens with them.
This tape This tape blows up the world.
Which is what we should do, don't you think? Did you consider Hannah a friend? Not really.
An acquaintance would be more accurate.
Reporter, can you mark this document as Exhibit three.
Can you tell me who this is in this photo? It's hard to tell.
That's not you in this photo? I thought we were here to talk about Hannah.
I'm not sure what you're trying to pin on my daughter Mr.
Crimsen, you're here as a courtesy.
Your daughter is 18.
She can talk about this photo now, or do it in court.
Thank you for meeting me.
You were the only one who tried to tell me the truth.
Are you I promised myself that I wasn't going to say something stupid like "are you okay" or "how are you doing," because, like, how the fuck do you think, right? But how are you? How the fuck do you think? Yeah.
Do you need to talk to somebody? See somebody? Who? I'll burn these.
I'll light them on fire and let them burn until they're I don't know, melted plastic and ash.
It's your call.
But if you want to fight if you want him to pay you for what he did, these tapes can help.
They're proof.
You want me to tell the whole goddamn world what happened to me? I want you to do what you want to do.
Whatever's going to make this better for you, if anything can.
But I'm not gonna lie.
I want him to pay for what he did.
Will he, though? I mean have you listened to the last tape? You know what happens when girls try to get help? I listened to the last tape.
And I think I should pass the tapes on like Hannah wanted.
I'd have to tell the police, I'd have to tell my dad.
Yeah.
I don't think I can do that.
Okay.
You think I'm letting Hannah down.
I think we all let Hannah down.
And I think she let you down.
So Thanks for talking to me about this.
And I guess let me know if there's anything if there's anything.
Clay.
Don't burn the tapes.
Look.
The jocks, they walk the halls like they own the place.
The teachers feed into it.
Bolan feeds into it.
It's just it's how it is.
But you dated athletes.
Objection.
Relevance.
She's here to talk about Hannah Baker.
Yeah.
Of course I dated jocks.
There are decent jocks, you just gotta learn how to find them.
Hannah never learned.
It's not her fault.
I mean you try going to school with a bunch of Neanderthals who are told they are the only thing of value at school, and that the rest of us are merely there to cheer them on and provide them with whatever support they need.
So, you texted Hannah more than once that she had terrible taste in guys.
What did you mean? What I meant what I mean is that, if I hadn't moved away if I hadn't let her start dating Justin if I'd been around to help her through it she'd still be alive today.
And Justin is Justin Foley? Yes.
Justin is Justin Foley.
Are you and Justin still friendly? Justin Foley is dead to me.
Jesus Christ, are you following me? I have to talk to you.
- Justin! - Jess, please.
I I've been walking around all night.
I've got no place to live, okay? Shit Shit's so fucked up.
You think? - Just talk to me.
- Why, Justin? Why should I talk to you? Last night, I I walked every street in this shitty-ass town.
And I ended up by the water, by the docks.
I climbed up this crane, all the way up there, and I could I could see the whole city.
And I was gonna jump.
Or shoot myself.
But I couldn't.
Because I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I can't stop.
Try harder.
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
I'll fucking go to the school.
I'll talk to the cops.
I'll kill Bryce.
If you want, I'll kill him with my bare hands and pay the price.
Just please tell me what you want.
What I want is never to see you again in my life.
All I'm saying is if you throw like you threw in divisionals last year, we'll be fine.
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
Never be Jeff Atkins, though.
I fuckin' miss that guy.
He was a good dude.
Aah! Fuck! Shake it off, man.
It's just rust.
Nah, I fucked up my hand last night.
Jesus! Who'd you hit? Ah, just the wall.
You gotta watch that temper, bro.
You telling me to watch my temper is like Justin Foley telling me to lay off the weed.
Where is that guy, anyway? No clue.
You figure your shit out? From the other night? Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.
All right, let's go.
A few days after I recorded tape 12, I saw Bryce in the hallway.
And congrats to our Liberty Tigers on their first win of the season! Game ball goes to Bryce Walker, 12 catches and two touchdowns! I thought I could never show my face at that school again.
Everything was dark for days.
But then just a little flash of light.
A flash of light, and you think, maybe I feel like, as a society, our priorities are all out of whack, you know? Yeah.
Clay What? Never mind.
I'll see you in Bradley's.
Mr.
Porter.
Clay.
What happened? Are you all right? Yeah, no, I'm fine.
It's just I know I'm still on suspension, but I I needed to talk.
Is that okay? Yeah, sure.
Come on.
I was glad to see you on my calendar.
Why? I'm just glad you made an appointment to come talk.
So, uh what's on your heart today? Well, uh just everything, I guess.
Okay, every everything, huh? Everything is a lot.
Why don't we start with how you're feeling right now.
Right now? Yeah.
Right now.
Lost.
I guess.
Sort of empty.
Empty? Yeah, I don't feel anything.
Like I don't care anymore.
You don't care about what? About anything.
School.
Myself.
The people here.
My parents.
Your parents? I mean, I care about them, but I'm not I'm not who they need me to be.
Well, who do they need you to be? Not a problem.
Really? Well, how are you a problem to them? I don't know.
You can get that if you want.
Uh, no.
No, uh Listen, what about your friends? Do you care about them? Friends? What friends? Now, I know you have friends.
I see you in the halls.
Yeah, well Jessica Davis.
Alex Standall.
And I've seen you around with Courtney Crimsen.
They're not my friends.
What about Clay Jensen? Clay Jensen hates me.
Clay.
Clay.
So what's on your mind today? I wanted to talk about Hannah Baker.
She pushed me away.
I was thinking about how hurt I was, and I didn't even for a minute stop to think that she was hurting too.
Look, Clay whatever happened to Hannah, between you and her, with other kids, she made that choice to take her own life.
But why? Why did she make that choice? We can't know that for sure.
What if we could? What if we knew what we did wrong? I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.
I don't know him all that well, but he doesn't seem the type to hate anyone.
It's like it doesn't even matter what you say.
Maybe it does.
I don't know.
Okay, I'm not following you.
You know what? Never mind.
Wait, hang on.
Don't go.
Just Just help me out here.
Please.
When you leave this office how would you like things to be different for Hannah? I don't know.
I I'm not sure what I'm expecting.
All right.
Well, it sounds like there's something that you need that you're not getting.
So, let's start there.
I need it to stop.
You need what to stop? I need everything to stop.
Just People.
Life.
Life? You know, it's natural to blame yourself, but we all do the best we can.
I think that's bullshit.
I think we should blame ourselves.
I think we all could do better.
We can try to love each other better, but we're imperfect people.
We love imperfectly.
We don't always get it right.
How can you just live with that? I mean, you're a counselor.
I have to live with it.
You can know all the signs and understand the issues, and still come up missing something.
That's not good enough.
What about the next kid who wants to kill himself? Do you think about hurting yourself? The other night, I almost threw myself off a cliff.
I'm glad you didn't.
You may not feel that way in a minute.
Why do you say that? Hannah Baker came to see you the day she died.
Hannah.
What did you mean when you said you needed life to stop? I don't know.
'Cause that seems like a very serious thing to say.
I know.
I I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that, I guess.
So what happened, Hannah? How did you get here? Just one thing on top of another.
If I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna need you to be a little more specific.
I'm sure you've heard some of the rumors about me.
I haven't, actually.
What do these rumors say? Last year, I was voted actually, not voted.
Someone made this stupid list.
"Best of, worst of" thing.
And people have been reacting to it ever since.
When was the last time? A week ago.
At a party.
What happened at the party? She told you what happened to her.
Look, even if she did come to visit me this is not something I can talk about.
So, if I tell you that I'm going to kill myself, you can't tell anyone? Yes, I can tell your parents.
You know, I can tell who I need to tell in order to get you the right medical attention.
Did you tell anyone about Hannah? Hannah never told me she was thinking about killing herself.
- But you did see her.
- I didn't say that.
You saw her.
And she told you things were bad.
That she didn't care about anything, that she wanted everything to stop.
When did you talk to her last? She told you how she got to that point.
Was there Did you have an encounter at the party? An encounter? Yeah, you could say that.
Did You don't want to talk about this.
No, I do.
Listen, Hannah, I'm not gonna judge you but did anything happen that night that you regret? Yes.
Are you embarrassed by what happened? Yes.
Maybe you made a decision? No, I A decision to do something with a boy that now you regret.
Oh, my God, no! That's just what you assume? No, I'm just asking you.
I didn't make a decision.
Okay.
Sorry.
Um Did anything happen at the party that may be considered illegal? Maybe.
- Alcohol? - Yeah, but I wasn't drinking.
Drugs? Not that I know of.
Did he force himself on you? I think so.
You think so? But you're not sure.
Did you tell him to stop? No.
Did you tell him no? No.
Maybe you consented, then changed your mind.
No, it's not like that! Should we involve your parents or the police? No! Hannah, who's the boy? Who's the boy? She couldn't give you a name.
She didn't use the word, but she described the rape.
- Again, I can't - I know you can't.
So let's talk about a hypothetical student who says she was raped but won't say who did it, or can't.
When a student is assaulted, I'm required to go to the police.
But I need to know exactly what happened, and who did it.
If I tell you will you promise me that he'll go to jail? And I won't ever have to see his face again, that I won't have to face him? I can't promise you that, Hannah.
But I will promise you this: I will do everything in my power to keep you safe and protect you in this process.
But I can't do that unless I know everything that happened.
Like a name.
A name.
Bryce Walker.
Bryce Walker raped Hannah.
If you can't give me a name if you don't want to press charges against this boy if you're not even sure you can press charges then there really is only one option.
What is it? I'm not trying to be blunt here, Hannah, but you can move on.
You mean do nothing.
Is he in your class? He's a senior.
That means he'll be gone in a few months.
Are you fucking kidding me? It can be very dangerous to accuse someone of a crime like that.
I have his confession.
How do you have his confession? I asked him for it.
I took Hannah at her word, which is what you should have done.
I believed Hannah, and I accused Bryce of rape, and then he beat the shit out of me and admitted it.
I think maybe now is where we stop this conversation.
- Okay.
All right.
- Yeah.
But wouldn't you like to know what happened after Hannah left that day? Look, something happened, Hannah.
And I believe you.
But if you won't confront him then the only other choice is to move on.
Yeah.
That's just what I'm going to have to do.
Thank you, Mr.
Porter.
Okay.
There's more to talk about, other resources.
No, I think we figured it out.
I need to move on and get over it.
Hannah, I didn't say get over it.
But sometimes that's the only other option.
Look, you're right.
I know.
Hey, Hannah, you can sit down.
You don't need to be in a hurry.
I need to get on with things.
If things aren't going to change, I'd better get on with it.
Hey, Hannah.
She walked out of this office and she hoped you would come after her.
Okay.
I can have that for you His door is closed behind me.
Right.
Yes, sir.
- But you didn't.
- Okay.
Excellent.
He's not coming.
I think I've made myself very clear but no one's coming forward to stop me.
Some of you care.
None of you cared enough.
Neither did I.
And I'm sorry.
So it's the end of tape 13.
There's nothing more to say.
You let her walk away.
We all let her walk away.
She walked out of school went home and put some things in order.
She returned her uniform to the Crestmont, where I worked with her.
She didn't say anything.
She dropped it on the counter and walked away.
She dropped a package off with a friend, then took another to the post office.
Hannah.
Oh.
Hey.
Robert.
Hi.
So good to see you.
We've missed you.
- You have? - At the group.
Linda even wrote a poem about it.
Oh, well, um - I don't really write poetry anymore.
- That's too bad.
Well, come visit sometime anyway, okay? - Yeah.
Okay.
- Don't be a stranger.
Then she went back home put on some old clothes.
She went into the bathroom filled the tub opened the box of razor blades she took from her parents' store that morning She got into the tub still with her clothes on slit her wrists and bled to death.
And she died alone.
Hannah? Why is the water still running? There's water all over the floor.
Hannah, come on.
Oh.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
Come on, honey, it's okay.
Come on, baby.
Hannah? Oh, sweetheart.
Come on.
Come on, honey.
It's okay.
Andy! Come on, you're okay.
You're gonna be fine.
Andy! Come on, honey, it's okay, you're fine.
Oh, God! Oh, Hannah! No, no! She's okay, she's okay.
- Call 9-1-1.
Call 9-1-1! - Oh, God.
Don't touch me, just call 9-1-1.
Tell them to hurry! Tell them to hurry! And you could have stopped it.
And I could have.
Justin Foley could have.
And a dozen other people, at least.
But we didn't.
It's powerful.
And painful.
Just to imagine what Hannah's last days were.
To try to understand what led her there.
But if she wanted to end her life we weren't going to stop her.
I cost a girl her life because I was afraid to love her.
You can't love someone back to life.
You can try.
Clay we don't know what was in her mind or in her heart.
There's no way to know why she did what she did.
Actually, there is a way.
Before she died Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.
And you're number 13.
And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.
And they always will.
And they'll know what they did.
You're the last person to get the tapes.
Hannah didn't leave any instructions on what happens after you so you get to decide.
And I added tape number 14 which I hope will help you make that decision.
How do you have these tapes? I'm number 11.
It has to get better.
The way we treat each other and look out for each other.
It has to get better somehow.
Skye.
Hey, Skye.
What? Hey, uh How's it going? Uh Fine.
Why? Listen, I was, um I was wondering if you wanted to, like hang out sometime? Okay.
When? How about now? How about we walk right out those doors and hang out for a while? Are you okay? No.
Is that all right? Yeah.
That's fine.
Tyler, honey, it's time to go.
Tyler? Are you in there? Just a second.
Tyler, honey, it's time to go.
Tyler.
Tyler.
Mom.
Privacy.
I was calling for you.
We're gonna be late.
Sorry.
I was just grabbing a sweater.
Your dad is on his way from work.
Are you sure you don't want Mr.
Sebring to meet us there? Mom I didn't do anything wrong.
I don't need a lawyer.
I just worry.
Those kids are already picking on you.
If you have to talk about them Don't worry, Mom.
I can take care of myself.
We should go.
They said this afternoon's session starts at two sharp.
Andy, what's this? It's nothing.
It's an application for Walplex.
Their pharmacy's open till eleven.
I can do night shifts.
No.
Absolutely not.
This case could go on for a long time, Liv.
Mrs.
Baker.
Tony, what What are you what is it? I, uh I have to apologize for not telling you everything.
Hannah asked me to keep secrets for her.
I wanted to honor that.
But I've come to believe I need to share something with you.
There are 14 audio files on there.
You should listen to them in order.
I have the original tapes, and for reasons you'll come to understand, I have them hidden somewhere very safe.
But if you need those, I will bring them to you too.
What's on here? What kind of files? I I really think you should just listen.
What happened to Hannah I wish that would never happen to any other kid, ever.
And if giving you this helps that, then I'm sorry.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
We're going to be late.
I would say that the climate at Liberty High School as I have experienced it myself, is bad.
I get shit every I'm sorry.
It's fine, Tyler.
Just use your own words.
I get shit every day.
People trip me and slam me into walls.
Lock me in the bathroom stalls and pull my pants down.
And do you know if Hannah Baker experienced bullying like this? Again, Dennis asks for an expert opinion.
Did you ever hear anyone at Liberty speak unkindly to Hannah? Yes.
Can you tell me about the time or times that happened? It happened all the time.
Guys would call her a slut and say that she's easy, that sort of stuff.
Did you ever witness anyone being physically abusive to Hannah? - I bet it happened.
- Dennis.
Tyler, we have to ask you not to speculate.
Just talk about what you actually witnessed.
I saw how guys treated her.
I have pictures of it.
You have pictures of physical abuse? You have proof? No, no, not physical abuse, but Okay, let's, uh talk about There are tapes.
I'm sorry? There are tapes.
Hannah recorded tapes.
She talked about what happened to her.
And where are these tapes now? Last I heard, Clay Jensen had them.
Are you sure about that, Tyler? Last I heard.
Well, Dennis, without the tapes in evidence, I'd suggest we move on.
Hello? Miss Davis, it's important that you speak only to what you actually experienced.
Okay? So, you and Hannah were friends? Yeah.
For a while.
What do you mean "for a while"? We stopped being friends.
Can you tell me why you think that happened? 'Cause I slapped her.
And why did you slap her? Because I thought she was fooling around with my boyfriend.
And why did you think that? Because Because guys talk at our school.
And they do sh They do things to girls that no one ever talks about and no one ever does anything about.
Things like what, Miss Davis? Like what do you think? Be helpful if you could tell me.
Miss Davis, I know this is difficult, but it's important you tell us.
- Argumentative.
- Hardly argumentative.
Dennis.
Don't force her to answer.
Okay.
Okay, Miss Davis.
Uh, do you know anything about tapes that Hannah recorded about what happened to her? No.
When did you go to vodka? Since I needed to travel.
Whoa, no, no, no.
You promised me a drink.
They got you going to the lawyers today? I didn't go.
Good.
Good.
How did Jensen know? About me and Hannah Baker? Hannah Baker made these tapes before she died.
Saying what we all did to her.
What you did.
To Jessica.
To Jessica? She was in the room that night.
Hiding.
You've heard these tapes? Yeah.
I'm on 'em too.
And who has them now? At this point, I don't know.
Jesus.
But who's gonna believe a dead girl, right? I guess we'll find out.
Justin.
Justin.
You know the real story, right? You know what's true.
I do now.
So I'll see you around? Nah, I don't think you will.
You did great today, kiddo.
You did your friend proud.
Thanks.
You okay? Fine.
Yeah? You don't look fine.
Daddy? I need to tell you Something happened.
To me.
Fucking leave her alone.
These are thousand dollar cameras.
And I'll break 'em on your face.
Jesus, Montgomery, leave him alone.
One last try.
I'm giving life one last try.
Kevin.
Alex Standall shot himself in the head last night.
He's in critical condition at Mercy.
Here we go.
Hey.
It's Hannah.
Hannah Baker.
Good God.
That's right.
Don't adjust your whatever device you're hearing this on.
It's me, live and in stereo.
No return engagements, no encore So, what happens next? I don't know.
I guess we'll find out.
Should I put a tape on? How about we just listen to the radio? That's a great idea.

(Hannah): A rumor based on a kiss ruined a memory I hoped would be special.
In fact, it ruined just about everything.
13 Reasons Why was a really special story to me, especially when I read it for the first time when I was 14 because people were just really mean in middle school.
And it really did change my perspective on how to treat people, because you really don't know what other people are going through.
(Luke): High school can be a tough environment for an individual to grow and to come in their own.
(Langford): One of the big differences about 13 Reasons is that we're treating the audience like young adults, not as teenagers.
We're treating them as people.
(Flynn): There's nothing about this story that's polite.
You can really tell a story that's gonna start a conversation.
As a society we tend to shy away from these hard topics.
Sometimes in cinema we do that, too.
This is great because it says, "No.
This is a problem and it needs to be addressed.
" (Asher): The whole issue of suicide is an uncomfortable thing to talk about, but it happens, so we have to talk about it.
And it's dangerous not to talk about it because there's always room for hope.
We wanted to do it in a way where it was honest, and we wanted to make something that can hopefully help people, because suicide should never, ever be an option.
(Minnette): To not seek out help, or to end it, is just tragic, because who knows what you could have gone on to do? Just see the future, know that there is so much life ahead of you.
(Walsh): These are all things that need to be discussed, and we need to educate both young men and women.
(Zach): If one thing had gone differently somewhere along the line maybe none of this would have happened.
(McCarthy): At the end of the day, we tell stories.
We're storytellers, and our job, probably more than anything, is to entertain.
But you get a piece of material like this that's about something, you know, you take that seriously, and and you really hope the discussion begins and will continue.
(Yorkey): We wanted to begin by telling the truth about what effect these events would have.
We felt like if we could tell a story, not only with integrity, but hopefully one that had a chance to really resonate with young people who don't necessarily get a steady diet of truth in their entertainment, and hopefully could stand as something that was an honest representation of their experience.
(Shrieks, then giggles) (Langford): With the photo that's taken of Hannah, it was innocent, but an unflattering photo out of context, posted by a guy with a particular rep, or saying something, or spinning the story some kind of way can destroy someone.
And when Bryce takes the photo from Justin and sends it round the school, it's the beginning of the end for her.
It does irreparable damage to Hannah's reputation.
She can't go around and personally remedy it for everyone.
(Boe): It's definitely a generational thing because my whole middle and high school, when we got home, all we would do is hop on, either it was Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
So, that's our whole world, is our school, and then social media.
So, that's why when you're being cyberbullied, you're being attacked by so many people who are hiding behind, you know, a computer screen.
(Dr.
Hu): Adults don't realize how much cyberbullying is hurtful because it didn't exist when people my age were younger, and cyberbullying doesn't end when the school bell rings.
Once something is online, it's just there, and a picture can say a million different things.
And people come up and conjure up their own story, or what they think is right, and it affects you, it hurts you.
Suddenly you can feel so terribly alone, and because of their interaction and because they're so engaged and tethered to their devices, there actually is no safe space.
(Yorkey): The adults tend to trivialize what for teenagers and young adults is not trivial.
Teenage brains don't work the way adult brains work.
You know? Trauma and pain feel like they're gonna last forever.
And I think that we forget that sometimes.
(Teefey): Hopefully sharing these stories can can help parents pay attention to things that may be small to them, but could be rocking the world of their kid.
Pardon me but you really hurt my feelings.
(Yorkey): In high school, your reputation is everything.
And she stopped being a human being to all those guys, and became a thing.
(Dr.
Hsu): The topic of slut shaming, like what happened with Hannah, we're in a place where, on the one hand, girls feel incredible pressure to be rated on being attractive, um, to be popular, to be good-looking, to look perfect on Instagram.
And yet if it goes just a touch too far somehow, now you're a slut, nobody likes you, you're not worthy of being a real girlfriend.
(Jones): I think the hard thing about the minute that a girl in this context is labeled a slut is because it's just a snowball effect, because it gives people permission to continue to treat her as though she's a sexual object instead of a human being.
Somehow all those things get mixed up, especially for girls and women.
And for a girl who's just developing her identity, and just developing her body, and just learning about sexuality and relationships, it's a lot of hurdles to navigate.
(Hannah): I wanted you to do everything you were doing, so I don't know why my mind took me everywhere else.
Growing up and going through high school is when you're meant to be learning about who you are, and maybe having, like, your first sexual experiences, having your first boyfriend or girlfriend and trying to figure that out.
And this huge culture of slut shaming affects her, ultimately.
(Voices echoing) Thought you were easy.
(Heartbeat increasing) Thought you were easy.
Stop it.
Okay, sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, just stop, okay? (Minnette): I don't think Clay has any idea what's going on in that moment because I think at first he wonders He thinks he did something wrong.
I think it's just, like, pure confusion, like just obviously there's something going on that he had no idea about.
(Dr.
Hu): At that point, Hannah's been through so much, even being with a nice guy, like Clay, she starts to get almost Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
(McCarthy): Through the process, everyone was reflecting on their high school experiences.
Things they did right and wrong, things they regret.
There's moments of like, "That one guy, I remember I did that, I shouldn't have.
I should've spoke up.
" I hope there's discussions like that, not just between friends in high schools and colleges when this show airs, but between parents.
You have nothing more to tell me about bullying at school? No.
Or, um Hannah Baker? Look, I told you, Mom I didn't really know her.
(Yorkey): A big part of Clay's story is that he is not a kid who can communicate how he's feeling, or what's on his mind.
This is one of the most powerful moments of the show for me because it rings so true to who I was when I was a teenager, where you have so much going on inside of you and so little ability to share it with anybody.
I certainly remember experiencing things when I was younger, and being so overwhelmed because I had no idea what it was, or what I was feeling.
And it's hard to talk about when you can't put it into words correctly.
I guess, in a way, it'd be healthier to sit there with your mom and say, "All these things are going wrong, and life is just happening so fast, and I'm so young, and I can't handle it," but no one has that awareness.
Even someone as smart as Clay.
It's not because you don't love them or don't respect them.
It's more just, "What do I say? What will they say?" They won't understand.
You gotta start opening up to us, kid.
Just, you know, let us know what's going on.
It's hard to be the parent of a teenager.
The teenagers are trying to establish some independence.
Sometimes when they would like help on some level, they're also pushing it away.
And both Clay and Hannah, at times, really would like some help, but don't know how to ask for it.
(Teefey): I feel like parents being honest and not ignoring issues and not ignoring what they went through will really help kids, I think, be a little bit more comfortable.
And, I mean, I always told her: "You don't have to tell me everything, but if it's really something that's important, I'm here and there's no judgment.
" (Asher): I think that's what people really identify with because we've all made those choices not to open up, even though a person was right there asking how we were doing.
(Mr.
Porter): I was glad to see you on my calendar.
(Hannah): Why? I'm just glad that you made an appointment to come talk.
(Yorkey): The scene with Mr.
Porter in the last episode, Hannah missed the opportunity to say what had happened to her, and Mr.
Porter missed the opportunity and missed a lot of signs to see that this was someone in immediate crisis who needed more help than he gave her at that moment.
(Asher): You know, Hannah's an imperfect person.
She pushes people away, people that we know would have been there for her.
You know, she could have been more open.
But in a way, she kind of sets up Mr.
Porter to fail.
I think it's okay to recognize that.
She wasn't perfect, she didn't do everything she could.
And she should have done more.
So, what happened, Hannah? How did you get here? Just one thing on top of another.
(Mr.
Porter): If I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna need you to be a little more specific.
(Yorkey): The challenge for Hannah is that she would've had to have the strength to describe what happened to her, and the courage and determination to label it rape to get his attention.
And she was not able to do that.
And that is not her fault.
Sexual assault comes with so much shame, on top of the pain, on top of the violation, that for victims to talk about it is incredibly hard.
And takes an incredibly safe space and someone who is very skilled in making it possible for the victims to talk about it.
Mr.
Porter didn't have that skill.
Sometimes you can be trying so hard and miss it.
You can be sincere, but sincerely wrong.
Did? You don't wanna talk about this, do you? No, I do.
I think first and foremost is schools can teach more emotional education.
I think we're lacking so severely in that arena.
It's very common for young adults to not recognize their emotions, to not be able to verbalize them, talk about them.
If Hannah had been able to understand what she was feeling, and why, then it could've made all the difference.
You can sit down, you don't need to be in a hurry.
I need to get on with things, Mr.
Porter.
If things aren't gonna change, I better get on with it.
- (Phone ringing) - Hey Hey, Hannah (Yorkey): You only know what they're willing to tell you and you only know what they're able to tell you.
They may Instagram and Snapchat and, you know, Facebook their lives, but that's curated.
Even with all that, you still don't really know what's going on in their life.
(Bryce): There you are.
Hey, we're playing beer pong out back.
(Both laughing) - Dude.
- You want to go? No, no, no, dude, I'm all right.
I'm sticking around for Jessica.
(Laughing): She's so wasted.
Oh, yeah? It was an interesting discussion in the writers' room approaching the scene where Justin lets Bryce in to ultimately have his way with Jessica.
And there were people who said: I don't No one can No one would do this.
It's impossible to do this.
A lot of times guys will have this concept of the bro code, that if their friend is assaulting someone else, whether it's their girlfriend or someone they don't know, that they just are gonna kind of look the other way.
And unfortunately this is not as rare as we would like it to be.
What's mine is yours, right? (Jones): That's when it becomes dangerous, is bro code at the expense of accountability.
And instead of saying, "Yeah, I have your back in all situations, unless you do something legitimately sketchy," and then true bro code, and true friendship is, "I would never let you put yourself in that situation.
" (Dr.
Hsu): The bystander effect, when we talk about how could someone not interfere if you think something terrible is going on.
In the scene at the party, not only is Justin culpable, there's, I think, maybe some people wondering: "Why didn't Hannah do something?" You know, you put yourself in that situation.
Hannah was drunk, Hannah was hiding, not supposed to be there.
And to be honest, I think she didn't realize it was happening.
Then all of a sudden it was happening, and then it was over.
(Jones): We don't realize actually in that moment so often people are completely frozen.
You're like, "If I was in that situation, I'd have totally done something.
" And I think it's easy to talk about in theory, and the truth is, it requires such a bold, authentic confidence to stand on your own two feet, and to stand up for what you believe in, not in theory but in a moment in which we're asking people to be brave for the 15 seconds it matters most.
(Boe): When I read episode nine, I called a very close family member who is a rape survivor, and she was so grateful that we weren't shying away from the ugliness because she told me that that is the only way that people are really going to understand a rape survivor's mind and what they had to go through.
I remember the table reads for this stuff.
Just reading it on paper was devastating, and then having to bring it to life was really fucking hard to do, so I can't even imagine what a lot of these girls are going through, or anyone who is a survivor of sexual assault.
(Boe): Jessica's forever changed.
It's a permanent, permanent thing, which I hope people, young boys, especially, who will watch this, understand that it's not okay to get drunk and then just have your way with people, because you are changing that person's life and your own for the rest of your life.
A lot of people who have, at some point, committed sexual assault, or some form of it, or rape, they're acquaintances.
They're They're people that you know.
This is one of those things that needs to be talked about and addressed.
Not saying anything can also be very dangerous.
If Bryce doesn't have consequences, he's gonna keep doing what he's doing.
She wanted me.
Me.
She was practically begging me to fuck her.
If that's rape, every girl at school wants to be raped.
Someone like Bryce, we call them a predator, which he is.
But it's so important that the show really depicts that it's not so clear and so obvious.
He's a popular guy, he's an athlete, and that it's so common for a victim to feel like, "No one would ever believe me.
" Bryces exist.
They exist on every single campus, and in every facet of life, and I think there's an immense amount of misinformation for young men around what consent even is.
That's the disconnect in how we're poorly educating men and young women, and how we're failing them, because we're not educating them on what real consent actually looks like.
(Flynn): It just needs to be a part of a conversation.
Sometimes people think, "If I talk to them about sex, I'm gonna find out all the details.
" It's like, no, just talk to them about what should be done, you know? Begin it with: she needs to say yes first.
And so we have to literally give them the phrase of: "What do you say in that moment?" Which is even just pausing and saying: "Hey, I want to make sure you're cool with us having sex.
" Is this okay? Yeah.
More than okay.
That's actually incredibly sexy, and that makes any girl feel really taken care of, and I think if we can better program them with the right things to say, and teach them the impact that their actions have on people are actually very real, and have, potentially, very serious consequences, maybe we could do something about preventing it.
The reality is that someone who commits sexual assault is almost never a one-time offender and will often find victim after victim.
(Bryce): Can't believe Hannah Baker finally came to one of my parties.
(Yorkey): The scene in episode 12 of Hannah and Bryce in the hot tub was one of the two most difficult scenes to film.
We didn't look away from the sexual assaults in the show, because to do otherwise is to minimize what those characters go through and what teenage girls go through every day.
Well, uh, I better get going.
My parents are probably, like, super worried by now.
You just got here.
(Langford): One of the biggest goals was to represent everything as authentically and as truthful as possible.
And Jessica Yu, who directed, um, this episode, she really did put a lot of thought into the way it was gonna be shot.
You know, in the scene we stay on Hannah's face, and it's actually in the script where it says we stay on her face longer than is comfortable.
And I think it's important that we did that because it is uncomfortable.
I think it does a great job of showing you kind of exactly what this person might be going through.
We had counselors advise us in the writing of it, in the shooting of it.
They talked to Justin Prentice, who played Bryce, to Katherine Langford, who plays Hannah, really helping them understand what's going through the characters' minds, why they behave as they do.
I spoke with Rebecca Hedrick, um, and Rebecca Kaplan from It's On Us, and, you know, what I learned was (Stammers): I kind of had a bit of an insight into what people go through whilst an assault is happening.
Whenever someone is faced with a major trauma, they have the fight, flight or freeze response.
They will either fight their way out of it, run away from it, or freeze.
And especially if there have been accumulated trauma in the past, then one of the The more likely option would be to freeze, and that's what happened with Hannah.
She might even dissociate a little bit.
A lot of times victims of trauma talk about feeling apart from their body.
She goes blank.
You see the light go out of her eyes.
She's completely lost her sense of self at that point.
(Indistinct chattering and applause) (Jones): Very rarely do I think we show the bravery and the candor and the pain that exists on the other side of being a survivor.
And how damaging, how deeply damaging that is, both, we see with Hannah obviously, and we also see with Jessica.
When you're in that position, it is so hard to reach out because you feel you're gonna burden someone else, or you don't think people want to listen, or you don't think they care.
So many girls are afraid to come forward when something like this happens because immediately the victim-shaming, oftentimes, is actually worse than even the initial assault.
They have their entire character judged, criticized.
Well, why was she wearing this? Why did she go to that house? Why didn't she do X, Y, Z? When really that's not the point.
I think we need to start these conversations differently, and instead of asking what she did or didn't do, we need to ask what he did and why he was doing it.
It's on us to educate people on how to receive that kind of information when girls have the courage to come forward.
You okay? Fine.
Yeah? You don't look fine.
Rape should be a topic that we should all be able to talk about, and not feel ashamed.
I want survivors to know that it's not your fault, and it's okay to talk about it.
And you need to build a good support system to be able to heal.
The more often you tell your story of being assaulted, the more it loses power over you.
I hope that people watching this show will feel empowered to be able to go to someone for help.
(Jones): We see Jessica going through that, reaching out to someone that she knows loves her, that hopefully she can, you know, really get the help of adults and professionals to come in and help her with that.
I don't think any girl should go through that alone or think that she can handle that alone.
Some of you cared.
None of you cared enough.
Neither did I.
And I'm sorry.
(Yorkey): By the time we reach the last day of Hannah's life, she is completely depleted.
It's beyond simply being depressed.
She thinks her life is worth nothing.
And she thinks her life really only exists as a problem to other people.
And she has been treated time and time again as an object, so her sense of self and her sense of agency, her sense that anything she can do can make things better is gone.
(Dr.
Hsu): She stops trying, and she stops reaching out for any life lines, and she's not strong enough or healthy enough at that point to stand up and assert herself.
Sometimes I'll hear a parent say, "Well, not my kid.
He'd never do it, or she'd never do it because she's really smart.
Her grades are good.
" And it has nothing to do with that.
Young adults haven't fully formed their frontal lobe, or executive function as we call it, so everything that happens feels like this is forever.
They often feel like there's no way out, and this can lead to very impulsive acts.
(Yorkey): We had a number of people ask us along the way why we had Hannah kill herself in the way we did and why we showed it.
We worked very hard not to be gratuitous, but we did want it to be painful to watch because we wanted it to be very clear that there is nothing in any way worthwhile about suicide.
(Mrs.
Baker): Hannah.
Come on.
(Walsh): We just wanted to make that moment, particularly, as realistic as it possibly could be without ever having experienced that.
That's the moment, the sort of pinnacle of the series, where you talk about wanting to do honor to people that have actually had to go through this in their lives.
Like you want to pay tribute to them and make it real and authentic.
(Dr.
Hsu): As hard as it was to see the final decision that Hannah made when she died of suicide, I think it was important to show that it's not a pretty death, it's not an easy one, and then the pain that never ends for her parents immediately thereafter, who are left with this horrible burden.
One of the things that when I talked to parents, when I talked to Dr.
Hu, that it was important to sort of get in context with for how it completely consumes your life.
It's important for the viewers to see that there's often a lot of collateral damage when someone dies, and the person contemplating suicide might not realize how much their death will affect people that they love and that they didn't want to hurt.
(Hannah): For those of you who will now be looking for signs everywhere, what does it really look like? Yeah.
Here's the scary thing: It looks like nothing.
(Dr.
Hsu): There are statistics that say that for every suicide there's at least six people who are very intimately impacted.
(Dr.
Hu): People are at a higher risk of suicide if someone that they know has died by suicide.
And it seems counterintuitive, and yet the person who has survived somebody else's suicide often feels guilty and can blame themselves, and that seems to be a large part of what happens with Alex.
Alex Standall shot himself in the head last night.
He's in critical condition at Mercy.
(Dr.
Hedrick): Suicide is now the second leading cause of death for teenagers.
And every warning sign, every symptom of depression should be taken seriously.
A drastic change in behavior, a drop in their grades, getting in fights with their peers, or parents, or authority figures, substance abuse, these are all different signs to look out for.
(Heizer): A lot of times it feels like things you're experiencing aren't treatable, and that's why it can be overwhelming to try to explain it to someone because you just feel like there's nothing you can do about it.
But there usually is.
It's absolutely treatable.
Anxiety is, depression is, talk therapy, treatment centers, there's a million ways you can find help.
(Dr.
Hsu): I think a lot of times people feel paralyzed by: "I don't know how to talk about this.
Maybe it'll go away.
Maybe they seem okay.
I don't feel equipped to talk.
" But then nobody talks about it, and that's actually the worst thing that any of us can do.
Really, it's about just listening, saying, "I'll be there, and we'll find the help together.
" If someone watching this is feeling like their life doesn't have worth, I hope that you see around Hannah in this show all the people who care about her, and know that there are those people in your life as well.
(Dr.
Hu): It's okay to not be okay.
It's okay to not be perfect, and for everything to be exactly right every moment of the day, but that you can get past that.
It gets better.
You won't always feel this bad.
(Langford): Reach out, even if you feel like Hannah and can't talk to your parents, or don't want to tell anyone at school because you're embarrassed, call a hotline.
Talk to someone anonymously.
Just talk to someone because the minute you start talking, it gets easier.
And just know that there's life beyond what you're feeling at the moment.
I promise it will get better.
There is an entire future of incredible things waiting for you.
And if you go, you don't get to You don't get to see it.
I hope that this show really opens up a lot of conversations and helps people realize the smallest thing you do, the smallest thing you do to someone, the smallest thing you say, can change so much for better or worse.
Skye.
Hey, Skye.
What? Hey, uh how's it going? (McCarthy): It's more than a show about a young woman's suicide, or sexual abuse, sexual violence, rape, it's much more than that.
I think it's a wonderful way the show ends, with Clay just taking a minute to acknowledge a woman in his life who he hasn't connected with in a while.
And it's those small steps, which I think can make a big difference.
(Dr.
Hsu): I've seen that make a difference, and I've had people actually on their way to harm themselves kind of stall because they were thrown off because somebody was nice.
And I think that's where it starts.
It just starts with reaching out to people.
You know, saying, "Hey, what's up? You matter to me.
I'm glad you're in my world.
" It has to get better.
The way we treat each other and look out for each other.
It has to get better somehow.

[BUZZING] [TYLER] The truth is, everyone's still hurting.
Some more than others.
[THUDS] Oh, shit.
[CLAY] It's a fucking comma.
[CHUCKLES] So it signifies a pause.
As in, you paused getting a tattoo in order to faint.
Even just getting the tattoo, I fucking fail.
Hey.
Hannah will forgive you.
Look, I'm not I'm not thinking about her.
- It's okay if you are.
- I'm not.
I haven't for months now.
Okay.
And there's not gonna be a trial, her folks are gonna settle, Bryce'll get away with it, and you know, fuck it all.
Fuck the world.
All I care about is you.
[TYLER] Maybe we try to convince ourselves we're over it.
Maybe it works for a while.
Sure you're ready for this? Are you sure you are? I've done it before.
Yeah, I'm ready, I mean I have been, and I am today.
Ready.

I will do whatever I have to do.
I will text you every hour.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I promise I'll call.
Okay.
[TYLER] I tried not thinking about it.
Some days I was able to shut it all out and live my life.
Some days I wasn't.
But then I got home last night and got news I wasn't expecting.
- [LAINIE] How's Skye? - She's good.
You should invite her in.
We haven't seen her since, what, the seventh grade? - She hasn't really changed.
- We'll have her over for dinner.
- Um, Skye doesn't really do dinner.
- She doesn't eat? I mean, no, she eats, just not in situations with parents.
Clay, I need to talk to you about the trial.
What? What trial? Hannah's trial.
It's moving forward.
[STAMMERS] What? - You told me it was settled.
- We thought it was.
But the Bakers rejected the district's final offer today.
It starts tomorrow.
Tomorrow? How is that possible? They were up against the trial date.
At the last minute, the Bakers rejected the settlement.
So, I'll get to testify about Bryce? Sonya did tell me that you're not on either witness list.
Why not? Clay, each side chooses witnesses based on a variety of factors.
Bryce raped Hannah.
Why is nobody talking about that? You heard his confession.
You heard everything, before you dropped out.
I didn't drop out of the case.
I withdrew because your involvement created a conflict of interest.
Well, I'm not involved anymore, so can someone do something? If we knew the girl on tape nine.
Mom, it's not my place to tell you that.
- If she would come forward - This is a fucking joke.
He confessed! Clay, I'm worried about your anger.
You're worried about my anger? That's what you're worried about? I'm not angry, Mom.
I'm fine.
That's why you're never home? We had a deal.
I've had perfect attendance, kept up my grades, I get to have a life of my own.
The deal was that you would be safe.
You put a lock on your door.
Which you found out by trying to open it? Clay, I know this is going to be very hard for you.
It's not.
I haven't thought about Hannah in months.
So I'll just keep on like that.
[TYLER] This trial going forward, it affects the whole town.
We have to think about it all over again, how Hannah lived and how she died.
And how it changed all our lives.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.
So, your mom isn't too happy about you going back to school tomorrow.
Well, I have to go back with Jessica.
We promised we'd go back together, and she's going back tomorrow.
Okay, but we were thinking more like a week, maybe two? Dad, it has to be now.
- [CLEARS THROAT] 'Cause of the trial? - Yeah.
And I know people have been talking about me for months now.
- Who's been talking? - It's a small town, Dad.
I can't even go outside without people looking at me.
Or talking about what I did.
Or what Hannah did and I failed to do.
And I'm sick of hiding from them all.
You're not hiding from anyone.
You're recuperating.
I can still do that.
Just out there.
And Hannah's trial means people are finally gonna hear her story, and I want to help tell it.
Okay.
Well, you keep pushing ahead.
I'll tell the boss lady you're feeling stronger.
Good work today, by the way.
You think I'll get to testify? I don't know.
I think that's up to your doctors and the court.
Okay? Get some sleep.
I love you.
[DOOR SHUTS] [BUZZES] Hey, what'd they say? - I can go.
How about you? - They don't like it, but they said yes.
This trial has me freaked out.
What have people been saying about us? What do they know? We're gonna find out.
Jess Look, whatever happens, we're gonna stick to the plan.
I don't remember what happened to me, just like you don't remember what happened to you.
- Right? - Right.
You feel okay about seeing Bryce again? - Yeah.
Totally.
- [GUNSHOT ECHOES] [TYLER] You hurt.
Worse, you feel powerless.
I know some people don't want us to talk about what happened but if we don't talk about it, it's never going to change.
So it's important for everyone to understand how it all happened.
The whole story, you know? Because things at Liberty are as bad as they've ever been.
Mom, it's gonna be fine.
No, I don't mind being the first kid to testify.
I want to be the first.
Yeah.
I told the lawyers that.
I know.
Yeah, I know.
[SIGHS] All right, look, I'll be home soon.
Okay? Bye.
And I don't want to be afraid anymore.
I don't want to be afraid.
[MRS.
DOWN] I don't know why this case is going forward.
I don't why you need to be the first.
- The way these kids abuse you - That's why I have to be first.
They want me to talk about how things are at school, and somebody has to do that.
It's very brave of you, Tyler, to want to do this for Hannah.
It's not just for Hannah, okay? It's for me, and Alex, and and I have to.
Okay, your dad's on a double and they have extra units outside the courthouse.
If you need anything, call me, okay? I can get coverage if I have to.
Mom, did I leave a note? Yes.
You left a note.
I want to see it.
Alex, honey, I I don't know that you're ready to What? To know the truth? Or know why I did it? Is this that you don't want me to think about it or you just don't want to talk about it? It's my goddamn note, Mom, I want to see it! - What, did you throw it away? - Of course we didn't throw it away.
Okay.
How about I give it to you the next time you see Dr.
Ellman? God.
Mom, I promise you, I'll talk to him about it.
Please.
Do you want to talk about it? [INHALES] Um What does this mean? "I could have stopped it.
" What does that mean? How could I have stopped it? It just means that you felt terrible guilt.
That you felt responsible, but that is too much for any one person to take on.
You know that now, right? "I could have stopped it.
" [WOMAN] Good morning.
[SIGHS] Are you ready for battle? Is anyone ever really ready for something like this? You are.
We are.
Thank you, Jackie, for being here.
Truly, it's above and beyond.
This is what I do.
I'll be the only one in that room who truly knows what you're going through.
Remember that.
I will be your strength.
I'm not afraid.
I'm not.
I mean, for so long, I've [SIGHS] I've dreaded this day, but now I'm just - I'm angry.
- Mm-hm.
- I'm angry.
At everyone.
- Good.
Hold on to that.
And your husband, were you able to convince him to? No.
[TYLER] Part of me didn't want to come to court today.
But I knew I had to be here.
For Hannah.
For her mom.
For everyone who gets bullied while Liberty still lets them get away with it.
Guys like Scott Reed, Montgomery De La Cruz, Bryce Walker.
- [MONTGOMERY] Thought it was gonna settle.
- Don't worry about it.
- What, is that Cory Jensen gonna testify? - Clay.
Don't know, don't care.
[GRUNTS] Yeah, all that Hannah Baker shit will get dredged up all over again.
My dad's got the trial covered.
We'll figure it out.
Now fucking Jessica Davis is coming back to Liberty? - Is that a coincidence or what? - Again, man.
Don't know, don't care.
Don't worry about the fucking trial, man.
[OLIVIA] I want them to hear Hannah's voice.
- We've talked about this.
- But, Dennis, I want them to hear - the pain she was in.
- Olivia, we'd have to argue best evidence just to get the tapes admitted.
- But Tony gave us the cassettes.
- Yes, and if one goes in, they all go in.
We can't get Porter without getting Hannah drunk.
Hannah taking her shirt off, leaving the scene of a crime.
- All right, what about Bryce Walker? - Again, we start with the school first.
It doesn't help to bring him and his father's legal team into it.
He raped her.
The school knew about it.
And unless there's corroboration, it's his word against hers.
We have to establish a pattern of activity that the school was aware of.
We're starting with Tyler Down? Because he can speak to the climate of bullying at Liberty.
And because we had yesterday to get subpoenas out.
I know.
I'm sorry, Dennis.
Just, when they put the NDA back on the table, I couldn't stay silent.
Hannah's story needs to be told.
And we're gonna tell it.
[DENNIS] Each day in this trial, you're gonna hear testimony from students who knew Hannah Baker at Liberty High, from adults at Liberty, from Hannah's own parents.
You'll hear about a girl in crisis, a poisonous school culture, and an administration that could have averted a tragedy, but didn't.
You'll hear about a beautiful, innocent, sensitive girl who was bullied to death.
And for every story you hear about a precious girl that we've lost, there are stories of the living.
There are lives in the balance.
Justice must be done.
For Hannah, and for those who are still suffering.
[SONYA] There's more than one side to every story.
The plaintiffs will tell you what they believe to be Hannah's story, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
No one is just a victim.
Her parents want to blame the school, but there's plenty of blame to go around.
You'll hear the full story.
And you'll make up your own mind.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] - [JESSICA] See you later.
Bye.
- [MAN] Okay.
Bye-bye.
Hey.
- You look beautiful today.
- So do you.
- I look damaged.
- It's a good look on you.
- See, everybody's checking you out.
- They're checking you out.
You're pretty and sad.
People love that.
You have a cane and a scar.
All my scars are inside.
[SCOFFS] We're definitely going to hell for joking about this.
Alex, my friend, we're in hell already.
I plan to look like I'm enjoying it.
[ALEX SIGHS] They're looking at you more.
- They're looking at you more.
- [SCOFFS] Which one of us is more tragic? Ryan should do another one of his stupid polls.
- I'll take that.
- I can carry my own books.
Well, clearly you can't, so let me help, don't be a dick.
- And welcome back.
- [JESSICA] Thank you.
I meant to ask you guys about my note.
- What note? - My suicide note.
- Jesus, put that away.
- It's not radioactive.
No, I know, it's just we're not allowed to talk about suicide.
Or you.
Or Hannah.
- Says who? - Says the school.
They made a rule the day after you after that day.
And if you talk about it on campus, you get suspended.
- That's so fucked up.
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.
- [TYLER] They find you in the hallway [ZACH] Let's go.
Who do you have first period? Mr.
Wood? Yeah.
I can't turn that fast.
- What are you running from, Zach? - Nothing.
Hey! Jess, Alex, welcome back, you guys.
- 'Sup, Alex? Jess.
- Seriously? "Welcome back"? Alex, stop.
I'll see you guys after third.
I'm gonna take the long way.
It's gonna be a good day.
- [LAUGHTER] - [SCOTT] I told you not to do that, man.
[TYLER] They act like they own the school.
[LAUGHTER ECHOES] Hey, man.
You okay? [TYLER] They get in your head I'm fine.
People tell lies about you, and other people believe them.
And it gets to the point where the lies might as well be the truth.
[DENNIS] And did people tell lies about Hannah Baker? Yes, they did.
All the time.
[TYLER] And another girl I know, she had something happen to her.
She had to leave school for a while.
While she was gone, the story got totally twisted.
They know Justin accused Bryce of raping her.
But after Justin left and Jessica stopped coming to school, Bryce just spun the whole story.
He said they that hooked up and that she, like, wanted it.
What? Then why would Justin say all that shit? Bryce said Jessica felt bad for cheating on Justin with him.
Such a fucking asshole.
With you guys coming back, maybe it's best that we just don't poke the bear, you know? - Let's try to get things back to normal.
- I don't think there is a normal anymore.
[PHONE BUZZES] [MAN] Be seated, please.
Two minutes.
[SONYA] Tyler, in your deposition, you said you took pictures of Hannah.
Yes, I did.
And it upset her and I felt terrible about it.
But isn't it true that Hannah actually enjoyed having you take her picture? - What? - Defense exhibit B.
Tyler did you take these pictures? Um yes.
[STAMMERS] Yeah, I did.
I did.
And was this before or after Hannah was allegedly bullied? I guess, before.
- And how did you come to take them? - I, um [SIGHS] It was the first day of school.
Sophomore year.
[TYLER] I was the Student Life photographer.
I was trying to get candids, you know, everyone still in their summer tan.
Hey, guys.
Hey, uh, yearbook? - Yeah, fuck it, whatever.
- Cool.
[TYLER] Football team.
Looking good, guys.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] - [LAUGHS] - What? They were special memories.
- Thanks, guys.
- It's bad enough we gotta Oh.
- That's that new girl.
- Yeah, Hannah Baker.
She's fucking hot.
- Smile, girls.
- Gross.
Tyler, go away.
It's for yearbook.
Hey.
Shoot me.
- What? - Shoot me and the locker that won't open.
- Yeah.
Yeah, all right.
Um - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [TYLER CHUCKLES] Uh, here, I can actually help with this.
I'm Hannah.
I saw you at Kat's party, actually, which I think was at your house.
- Yeah, it was.
- Sorry, this is just Cool.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
No worries.
- And your name is? - Oh, um, Tyler.
Tyler, yeah.
Uh, would you ever want to, I don't know, do a photo shoot or something? Sure.
I told her to come camera-ready.
[OLIVIA] Whoa.
Isn't that a little much? - You want to have a light touch.
Classy.
- It's for a photo shoot.
Where, in a brothel? Just take it down a notch.
Okay? Don't want people getting the wrong idea.
I could tell she had been crying.
I wasn't sure why.
She didn't need the makeup anyway.
She was so beautiful.
And she was so nice to me.
I'm sorry, I'm not camera-ready.
Sure you are.
It's good.
You're good.
Thanks.
Look, the whole point is to capture you as who you are, okay? Yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah.
So, should we? [TYLER] I wondered who made her cry.
Who made her feel like that when she only ever deserved to be happy? - Yes.
Okay, keep that up.
- [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [SCOFFS] Wow, you're you're really amazing.
- Thank you for doing this.
- Uh - Thank you for asking.
- Of course.
Perfect.
[TYLER] But like I said, the picture's only part of the story.
[SONYA] From these, it seemed that Hannah liked having her picture taken.
Well, I mean, that day You didn't tell us about that day.
What else are you not telling us? - [DENNIS] Objection, argumentative.
- [SONYA] Withdrawn.
Tyler, isn't it true that no real bullying resulted from any of the photos you took? No, it's not true.
I spread around a picture of Hannah.
And then Clay Jensen did the same to me.
But how could that be bullying if Hannah liked the attention? I mean, she she liked it then.
But when Justin and those guys sent that picture around it told a story that wasn't true.
- Oh, hey, Hannah.
What's up? - Hey, can I talk to you? [TYLER] I wanted to let her know I'd been there too.
I wanted to tell Hannah I saw her for who she really was.
Hey, Hannah.
[SIGHS] What? What do you want? Um Look, I just, I mean, I know that there's this picture going around Yeah, there is.
Thank you.
Look, I just wanted to say to you, um you're the most beautiful girl at Liberty.
If you want to do another photo shoot Are you out of your fucking mind? Get away from me.
[TYLER] I knew I had said the wrong thing.
I always say the wrong thing.
I printed out all the best photos from the shoot, so she could see how beautiful she was.
Even if kids at school wanted to see her as a slut or whatever.
And I wanted to give them to her, as like, a gift.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [TYLER] But she was with a boy.
And then I got shy, and I hid from them.
[CLAY] Have a good night.
[TYLER] I took out my camera, just so I could get a better look.
And - [PHONE CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] - I started to take pictures.
Hoping the pictures would make sense of what I was seeing.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [SONYA] What did you see? Hannah was doing more than chatting that night, wasn't she? - What did you see? - She wasn't just texting, okay? She was sexting.
And, like, showing herself off to some guy.
After everything she went through, I just didn't understand why she would do that, why she would share that special part of herself with just some guy.
Someone who didn't care about her, who didn't know how special she was.
So isn't it true that Hannah opened herself up for a reaction, and therefore, is in many ways responsible for what followed? Isn't she actually responsible? What about you, Tyler? Are you in no way responsible for the things that happen to you? Hey, Clay.
- Hey, Zach.
- Were you at court this morning? Yeah.
I couldn't take Tyler's lies, so I left.
So how is this gonna happen? Is everything gonna come out? How the fuck would I know? Well, when do you testify? I don't.
What? Why would they call me and not call you? I don't know and I don't care.
How can you not care? I care about my girlfriend and I care about my grades, and that's plenty.
When you're under oath, they can ask you anything, right? You stole a fucking note.
Not like you raped her.
What are you worried about? What about the tapes? What about the tape you made? Why are you still hanging around with Bryce? What does he have on you? I'm not hanging out with Bryce, okay? I just I have to play baseball with him.
And I was just hoping that this trial wouldn't fuck up everybody's life.
Well, too late.
[TYLER] I mean, it's not like it goes both ways.
There are the people who get hurt, and the people who do the hurting.
Mr.
Walker.
I was wondering if I might have a word with you.
Kind of in the middle of something, Mr.
Porter.
[SCOFFS] I'll wait.
Your hair looks good.
Get to class.
[FLUSHING] What's up? Jessica Davis is back today.
Wanna let you know I got my eye on you.
You and a dozen college scouts.
I don't know what that's got to do with Jessica.
Listen, you little shit.
I know everything that I need to know about you.
You go near the girl, you look in her direction, and I will fuck up your life.
[GAGS] I don't think you can speak to me that way.
I didn't.
[GASPS] - I was just checking in on you.
- [SPUTTERS] Thought you may be a little upset, with the trial starting and everything.
- You've got more to lose than I do.
- Do I? We'll find out.
[SLAMS DOOR OPEN] - The day so far, not great? - [GRUNTS] Why didn't you tell me they outlawed me? - What? That never happened.
- I mean, talking about me.
Or talking about me trying to kill myself.
- Shit.
Did they? - Yeah.
[SIGHS] I kind of stopped listening to morning announcements.
And teachers.
And people.
You had a question for me? Yeah, um, so you know that I left a suicide note? Um - Yeah.
- Why didn't you tell me about it? Well, I-I didn't I mean, I didn't think it was the kind of thing that you talk about with someone who's like, recovering from it.
Look.
What do you think that this meant? You have it here? Yeah, they can't suspend me for talking about me.
"I could have stopped it.
" What does that mean, "I could have stopped it"? Stopped what? I I don't know.
I mean You probably thought you could've stopped Hannah.
You felt guilty.
We all did.
I don't think that's it.
There's something more.
[SIGHS] [TYLER] No one likes the kind of attention Hannah got.
Or I got.
Or that I'm gonna get when I leave court today and have to go back to that school where no one looks out for us.
[BANGS] - The hell? - I never laid a hand on you.
Never.
I saw other guys fucking with you, I told them to back off.
So why are you talking about me in court? Jesus, how did you know that already? Did Clay tell you? Never mind, just tell me why you talked.
'Cause your little darkroom threat didn't scare me.
What "darkroom threat"? You can fuck with me all you want, I don't care.
You'll pay.
Mr.
Walker? Listen, if uh if Bryce hassles you again, you come and tell me.
And I want you in my new special skills class.
- No, thank you.
- It's not optional.
I spoke to your folks.
You can start tomorrow.
[TYLER ] I mean, Hannah took sexy pictures, but that doesn't make her guilty of anything.
One picture never tells the whole story.
[TONY] Clay.
Hey, Tony.
What the hell, man? You told me this case was gonna settle.
- [SCOFFS] We thought it was.
- Well, they called me to testify.
I-I wouldn't worry about it.
The Bakers know you did what Hannah asked.
The Bakers didn't call me.
The school did.
Why? I don't know.
My mom said each side calls whoever they think will help tell their version of the story.
How am I a part of the school's story? You didn't do anything wrong.
You don't know everything I did, Clay.
Hey, Tony.
What, um What do you know about Scott Reed? Uh, the baseball player? He plays baseball and he's friends with Bryce.
That's what I know.
Why? Uh, probably nothing.
[MAN] Okay.
So, we live in an "affirmative consent" state.
That means you must have an actual affirmative from your sexual partner in order to engage in intercourse.
Silence or lack of resistance does not demonstrate consent.
Consent must be given in words or in actions.
- Does a scream count? - [ALL CHUCKLING] [MR.
PORTER] You want to be a comedian, Mr.
Reed? Or you wanna play ball this year? 'Cause I can arrange that you take the season off.
I didn't think so.
Right.
So, affirmative consent.
Hey.
What? - It's good to see you, too.
- [SCOFFS] Oh, I'm sorry.
"Hi, Ryan.
How are things? Really? He is a bitch.
You should dump him.
You deserve better.
" That about cover it? They called me to testify at Hannah's trial.
Okay.
Me too, but we're not supposed to talk about it.
Here.
Everything she wrote about that day.
All of it.
I'm not gonna say anything that could hurt you.
I promise.
Thank you.
[TYLER] Pictures keep secrets, just like people do.
[GIRLS] four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six - Jessica, hi! - Hi! How are you? - You look good.
- I am good.
Thank you.
- Hi, I missed you.
- Oh, God, I missed you.
- Jess! - Hey, ChlÃe.
Jess, it's so good to have you back.
And just in time.
We're starting our routining for summer competitions.
- And I want you to be a flyer.
- Wait.
Wait, what? - I thought I was supposed - You have the athleticism and focus.
And hey, it's work, but you're ready, right? Totally.
I'm totally ready.
All right.
Well, let's start marking it out.
Jess, this one's new, so maybe watch first time around.
Okay, cool.
[WHISTLE TWEETING] [COACH] All right, Walker, all right.
Let's try that slider again.
That's right, guys, get it together.
Let's talk it through.
[EXHALES] [GIRLS] Five, six, seven One, two, three, four - [ZACH] You all right, man? - Yeah, of course.
Why? Well, that's three I had to chase.
I already did wind sprints today.
Yeah, the breaking shit isn't breaking.
[GIRLS] One, two, three, lift, five, six, seven, eight.
- One, two, three - Hey, it's all right.
You got this.
[BOY] Maybe you can throw something he can hit? I'm just picking grass out here.
I'm not gonna make the obvious joke about Mexicans picking shit.
All right, let's go, Walker.
The infields are trying to be funny, - and that never works.
- Oh, you love us, Dempsey.
[COACH] Last batter, Walker.
Then you gotta ice that arm.
[GIRLS] set, one, lift, three, up, five, six, seven So, you're sure your dad's not gonna come up? - Yeah, he visits as little as possible.
- Okay.
Anyway, he likes you.
Yeah, we bonded those first few weeks I visited you.
- What'd you bring? - Okay, so Cool Ranch Doritos.
- Sour Patch Kids.
- Yes.
Fucking amazing.
So this is really, like, illegal? Yeah, my mom has me on all like, organic whole-grain macrobiotic shit.
- So good.
You want? - [LAUGHS] Uh, yeah, but I should probably wash my hands first.
[ALEX] That's where it went.
The bullet.
That's where it went.
Yeah, I had never shot that kind of gun before, so it was heavier than the other ones, and I flinched.
And the bullet went up, and then in and out of my skull and into the wall.
That's what they told me.
You don't remember? No, I don't remember anything of like, a month before that.
So, the tapes? I know about them.
And I know we all did shit, but I don't remember listening to them.
I took pictures of you while you were in your coma.
Why? Because I knew you were gonna get better.
So I wanted to like, document how far you had to go.
I'm sorry, I I-I don't care.
Could I see them? Sometime? Uh Yeah.
Concession stand is almost done.
We're gonna be putting finishing touches on the outfield fence.
The new scoreboard's going up there, we're gonna re-line the fields, and get all the details done before Thursday.
All right.
How about the naming? Oh, well, it goes on top of the scoreboard, both dugouts and the concession stand.
- But all the plaques are up.
- And we don't think this trial we don't think this trial will be a distraction, do we? No, no, no.
No, no, no.
We have everything very well contained.
- We're protecting our students.
- Good.
Good.
How's the team? Oh.
Uh, well, despite the tragic loss of Jeff Atkins, I'm told we still have the best team in years.
Since your time, even.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] [BRYCE] Hey, Dad.
How's the arm? One hundred percent.
[CHUCKLES] Okay.
See you later.
Bye.
- Hey, Bethany, - [SCOTT] Right there.
That dude got demolished.
- Oh, hey.
- Ow.
[BRYCE] Hey, Jess.
Jessica.
- Hey, Jess, wait up.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Welcome back.
- Thank you.
So, how you doing? Okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm good.
- Good.
Good.
I mean, it's good to have you back.
We missed you.
The squad did, for sure.
- Yeah, well, I'm back.
- Cool.
Hey, let's grab a drink sometime.
Catch up.
- Let's grab a drink? - Yeah.
Whatever.
I'm late for dinner.
Okay.
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
[JACKIE] Thanks for having me over.
I'm happy to have the company.
The DoubleTree does free wine in the evenings, but it's all software salespeople and Rotarians, and - I'm just glad you're not sick of me yet.
- No, never.
Today was a good day, Olivia.
Tyler was believable, and the jury will remember the bullying more than anything else.
What are you working on? Oh, um - I asked Dennis to send over - Oh.
Some of the discovery that came up today.
I always thought these pictures were so beautiful.
- Ooh, that's a good one.
- [TAPS] That's not your best angle.
- [TAPPING] - That's good.
No, too much chin.
[SIGHS] Don't worry.
I'm deleting all of them.
I'm never taking another picture again in my life.
Why? A picture can be twisted, used against you, and haunt you forever.
My dear Hannah.
Such drama.
Why didn't I just tell her she was pretty? Why didn't I just say she was perfect? Oh, Olivia.
You did.
I know you did, thousands of times.
I don't know if I did.
Or I didn't enough, or or not in the right way.
Every morning, I would tell Tessa she was the most beautiful girl in the world.
Then she would go to that school where kids called her "ugly," called her "worthless," called her "slut.
" And she believed them, and not me.
This is what it's gonna be like, isn't it? They're going to paint this picture of some girl I don't even recognize.
Yes.
But you're going to have to stay strong.
You know who Hannah was.
What if I don't? I didn't know who took these pictures.
I didn't know she had a stalker.
What else don't I know? You know how special she was.
And how that school let her be taken away from you.
[TYLER] You have these pictures of Hannah.
And you say they mean one thing, but you don't know.
Just because you have the picture doesn't mean you have the truth.
[CLAY] Why'd you lie about Hannah? I didn't lie.
Why would she be sexting, after what happened? I don't know, but it was the truth.
[SCOFFS] Then who was it with? - I'm not afraid of you.
- What's that mean? - The darkroom last night? Come on.
- What about the darkroom? - Someone's trying to keep me quiet.
- Yeah, well, it wasn't me.
Then I bet they'll come after you, too.
I don't fucking care.
Who was she texting with? I don't know.
Fuck this.
I know you thought she was perfect, but she wasn't.
I bet I'm not the only one who knows that.
[DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [SOFT ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] I like the color.
Wal-Plex locked up their spray paint again, so I had to jack it from the True Value.
I love how the Wal-Plex locks up spray paint but not their ammunition.
[GIGGLES] Hey, can we, uh? Can we try this thing again? Yeah.
Let's do this thing.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] Jesus! [GROANS] Clay! Uh Sorry, I just, uh Sorry, I don't know what happened.
Okay.
What? Oh, my God, you're shaking.
What's wrong? Nothing, I'm I'm fine.
Okay.
Clay.
This is gonna be okay, you know? You're gonna be great.
Yeah, no, I know.
I mean, I don't know.
I mean, that's not Okay, shut up and get naked.
[CLAY CHUCKLES] What the fuck? What is wrong with you tonight, Clay? I can't.
- You said you loved me.
- No, I Look, I do.
God, I do.
You don't want to touch me, to be with me.
No, I do, I just I can't tonight.
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow, then.
[TYLER] Unless you were there, you don't know what really happened.
We'll ask the court for a medical exception.
I hear that Standall kid might not have to testify.
- Dad.
- Honey your mother and I don't like this.
We read about what happened to Tyler.
They can ask anything up there.
But I have to do it.
For Hannah.
Okay, let's talk about it in the morning.
Get some sleep.
[SIGHS] - [WIND CHIMES TINKLING] - [FAINT THUMP] [TIRES SQUEALING IN DISTANCE] [WIND CHIMES TINKLING] [GASPS] [TYLER] Just because you have the picture doesn't mean you have the whole story.
[HANNAH] What are you gonna do about that? So you talk now? Apparently.
Oh.
["LOVE VIGILANTES" PLAYING] [MAN] For help finding crisis resources, visit 13reasonswhy.
info.
Oh, I've just come From the land of the sun From a war that must be won In the name of truth With our soldiers so brave Your freedom we will save With our rifles and grenades And some help from God I want to see my family My wife and child waiting for me I've got to go home I've been so alone, you see You just can't believe The joy I did receive When I finally got my leave And I was going home Oh, I flew through the sky My convictions could not lie For my country I would die And I will see it soon I want to see my family My wife and child waiting for me I've got to go home I've been so alone, you see [VOCALIZING] When I walked through the door My wife, she lay upon the floor And with tears, her eyes were sore I did not know why Then I looked into her hand And I saw the telegram That said that I was a brave 

1 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [SOFT ROCK SONG PLAYS] [COURTNEY] What's the truth? What's true? I just think about you Got me wondering Why we never tried again I think we each have our own truth.
So let me get this straight.
[HANNAH] Okay.
You don't know why you're here.
You don't know how I'm supposed to feel.
You don't know why I haven't seen you and have tried not to think about you for months and then you show up tonight.
Precise and accurate, in true Clay Jensen style.
You're still allowed to make fun of me.
Allowed? Obligated? Who can say? Are you real? Do you see me? Are you corporeal? That seems like a science-fiction question.
- Can I touch you? - That seems like a loaded question.
This is fucked up, right? [STAMMERS] Like, I'm seriously fucked up.
I don't think you're fucked up.
You're just working through things.
- Things like seeing a ghost? - And other things.
So you are a ghost.
Okay, does it matter what you call me? I'm here.
- And you're here for a reason? - I would think so.
- But you don't know what it is.
- I was hoping you would.
- And you're not going away.
- I don't think so.
I mean, not for the moment.
[SCOFFS] Well, that's just fucking great.
- [LAINIE] Clay! - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Clay! You're going to be late.
Shit.
- Clay? - [KNOCKING CONTINUES] Are you all right? Uh, sorry! I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I overslept.
[SIGHS] - You slept in your clothes? - Yeah.
Homework and stuff.
- But, um, everything's okay? - Yeah, all good.
How was court yesterday? [SCOFFS] Why don't you tell me? I was just there to drop off some files.
How about you? I was just curious.
Clay, I know you said you don't think about Hannah, that you don't care about her anymore, but I am worried that that's not true.
Gotta get dressed for school.
Well - Okay.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Nothing's going on? - I have to go to school.
- And you don't care about me anymore? - Look, I tried, Hannah.
I did everything I could for you, and nothing worked.
Nothing.
And now you're back? And there's still nothing I can do.
If that's true, why am I here? Yeah.
Exactly.
[PHONE BEEPS] What the hell? Shit.
I gotta go.
[SIGHS] "Hannah wasn't the only one.
" What do you suppose that means? Who gave it to you? And why now, the day my trial started? - You think they're connected? - You think they're not? [HORN HONKS] I think that I need to get dressed, and go to school, and try to live my life.
[SIGHS] [SKYE] Saddle up, partner.
Did we talk about you giving me a ride? Did we have to? I mean, no, but, um Should we talk about last night? How about instead of talking, we just ride? [COURTNEY] We all have things we keep hidden.
Sometimes, keeping secrets is how you survive.
[MOTOR REVVING] [POP MUSIC PLAYING] Because in high school, - one rumor, one picture - Yes.
One incident, can define you forever.
You're doing the right thing, honey.
I know.
Now it's gonna be out there.
Everything I said in my deposition.
Look, what happened to Hannah after that photo, it happened to you, too.
And that is not your fault.
You told the truth.
And that's all you're gonna do again today.
[PHONE BEEPS] - [STEVE] Is that Mikey? - Uh [SIGHS] Aww.
Todd, look.
Wow.
Wow, he is a keeper, huh? I guess he is.
[COURTNEY] And the truth doesn't even matter.
Barry e-mailed me last night.
He said it was Bryce's idea, that Bryce asked you yesterday.
Asked me what? If we want to use their lawyer.
I'm not gonna let you take the stand without some guidance.
This kind of thing can ruin somebody's life, even if they're innocent.
I know, it's just We can find our own lawyer.
It's fine.
This is the kind of thing your father used to handle.
At times like these, we need to benefit from our associations.
[PHONE VIBRATES] - Who is it? - It's, uh Bryce, actually.
He probably wants to get some throws in before practice.
- I should go.
- Okay, honey.
And tell him thanks.
- No, I wanna testify.
- [GREG] But? [SIGHS] It's just Tyler Down, who testified yesterday, called out a couple kids, and they weren't happy.
That's all.
Well, if anybody gives you any flack, you tell me, and I'll handle it.
[CHUCKLES] Thanks, Dad.
[COURTNEY] When rumors spread, you can fight them or ignore them, but they never really go away.
When you're the target, you do anything you can to protect yourself.
[TAPE RIPPING] Jess! Hey! You wanna help? [BRYCE] Babe.
Where else you want 'em? [CHUCKLES] You guys are ridiculous, but sweet.
Babe, thank you for helping me with this.
Come here.
[COURTNEY] Sometimes you hide.
Sometimes you fight back.
Anything you have to do.
[ALEX] There you go.
Thank you.
- Good for you.
Let's go.
- [BOTH GRUNT] Such a gentleman.
This doesn't mean I'm gonna put out or anything.
What? Not even a handy? - Oh, my hand doesn't really work - All right.
Hey, you know what? Let's take the side entrance today.
- But it's way further, and I get tired.
- I can carry you.
Come on.
Okay, you're not Dude, you're not The whole reason I called you was to avoid another scene.
Getting picked up by my dad in the cop car was embarrassing enough.
[COURTNEY] Because the thing is, in high school, everyone's watching you, all the time.
You have to be careful.
[KEVIN] Get my note? About dropping by the office? I was hoping that we could chat.
- About what? - About anything that you need.
Anything I can do to help with what you're going through.
Really? You think you can be helpful all of a sudden? Yes, uh, I think I can.
Look, I know what you think about me, you know, and about what happened, but the most important thing to me right now, Jessica, is about keeping you safe.
[GIRL] Jessica! Hey, where you been? We still gotta celebrate, girl.
Uh, the squad made Jess a flyer yesterday.
- Wow, congratulations, Ms.
Davis.
- Thank you.
- Think about what I said, okay? - Yeah.
Asshole.
You're welcome.
Do I know you? Uh [CHUCKLES] Nina Jones.
And trust me, Porter's clueless.
It's better to keep your mouth shut around him.
[COURTNEY] You have to protect yourself any way you can.
So that's what I did.
- What's going on? Who are these people? - They're all here for you.
My e-mail list of concerned moms has over a thousand names in this county.
And moms do love a good craft project.
That's That's her school picture.
[JACKIE] Doesn't she look lovely? We're putting a face on this trial.
She told me that her foundation wanted to provide whatever support I needed.
- But she didn't specify a picket line.
- No.
You have to be careful, okay? These pyrotechnics can be useful, but don't forget this is still your show.
- I know that.
- And she's staying with you? Well, I have a spare room.
Dennis, the house is empty.
It is There's no reason for her to pay for a hotel room.
Just be careful.
[COURTNEY] I spread a rumor about Hannah and I'm not proud of it.
[DENNIS] And what happened after you spread that rumor? Boys asked me and Hannah to have sex with them.
Or got physical.
And they were aggressive.
[SCOFFS] And I couldn't handle it.
This was just a meaningless kiss.
All right? Girls do it all the time.
And what to your direct knowledge did the school do in response to Hannah being sexually harassed? Or the fact that a lewd photo of two students was being shared on campus? Nothing.
The school did nothing.
[CLAY] Who did this? Someone I talked about yesterday, I'm guessing.
At the trial.
This is what happens when you tell the truth.
Ask him.
Did you just come here to look at the destruction that is my life, or? No.
I was wondering, do you ever work with Polaroids? Amateur hipster tripe.
- I'll take that as a no.
- It's retro analog bullshit.
- There's no negatives, what's the point? - Unless that is the point.
So no one can make a copy? No, you can make a copy of anything, you just take a digital picture of it.
But, yeah, you want one print to hold on to, take a Polaroid.
Do you know these people? Tommy Shuster, Erica Charles, I think.
I shot Tommy a few times for baseball.
- So they go here? - They did.
They were seniors when we were freshmen.
Do you think he knew Scott Reed? Don't all those troglodytes know each other? Why do you care? I'm not sure I do.
Only have a second, coach.
I got a class waiting.
What's up? Well, I understand you had a little chat with one of my players yesterday.
I'd appreciate it if you'd come see me first next time.
Okay, well, it's my job to have a chat with students.
I can't be coming to you every time one of them happens to play baseball.
No, sure, sure.
Look, I'm glad we're working on awareness, and educating these kids about consent, and everything you're doing.
It's great.
I'm just looking for a little teamwork.
I give the right speeches, give me a heads up if you've got a concern about one of my guys.
Okay.
I got a concern about all your guys.
Heads up.
You know what, I'm sick of athletes always being the targets.
Coach.
Athletes have the run of this school, and you know it.
I just don't want them to run kids over.
You want teamwork? Check your boys, so I don't have to.
We've been talking about how do you control your impulses.
Today we're going to do an exercise that will help you think before you act.
Because you're gonna do the thinking for someone else.
You're gonna be someone else's eyes and their ears, and guide them around the room.
- Or out of a window.
- Maybe, Cyrus.
[SCOFFS] But you'll be switching blindfolds halfway through, so don't do anything you don't want done to you.
Okay? That means find a partner.
Or I'll find one for you.
You'd think they'd run these class names by a focus group first.
"Ass Class.
" You're a pretty good artist.
Kind words from the master photographer.
That was you, right? You won that photo contest with that night vision picture of the dog pissing last year? Punk rock, dude.
Should we? Why the hell not? Kinky.
We just shared a class together.
We weren't really friends.
[SONYA] But she didn't confide in anyone else about her fears, correct? I don't think so.
Not any other friends? Her parents? [HANNAH] I don't know, it could be a stalker.
[OLIVIA] A stalker? I highly doubt that kind of thing is going on in our neighborhood.
It's a real thing.
- Celebrities have them all the time.
- Oh.
- So we're a celebrity now? - No.
You know what I mean.
Forget it.
Honey, no.
Hannah.
Honey, I'm sorry.
All right, I just [SIGHS] Look, I think that you have a little anxiety about this new school.
It's not anxiety! Okay, I heard something out there last night.
Like clicking.
Well, maybe it was the wind.
Yesterday, your father was saying he thinks the raccoons are back.
It's not raccoons.
Honey, look, this is the safest neighborhood that, you know, we could afford.
Your father checks statistics on this kind of thing.
And I just know I know that for me, when I have a lot on my mind, my mind takes revenge.
Yeah.
You're probably right.
So, finding no help from home, she enlists you.
Mom can't help, but you can? Why you? [COURTNEY] I don't know.
But like I said, I was there.
And she was always nice to me.
[SONYA] Nice to you.
Defense Exhibit C, Your Honor, as stipulated.
Uh, I'm curious, Courtney, was Hannah just being nice to you there, too? Describe what you see, please? [SIGHS] There's, um more of Tyler's photos of Hannah and me, from that night.
[SONYA] Now, you said before that it was just a meaningless kiss, correct? [COURTNEY] Yes.
So, now how could it be meaningless if there's more than one? Or is that not a picture of Hannah kissing you back? [SPECTATORS MURMURING] - Hey.
- Hey, where were you this morning? I was avoiding ChlÃe.
And, like, everyone else.
What's wrong? - Someone's trying to keep me quiet.
- What? What happened? Not here.
Come on.
[ALEX] Wow, that is seriously messed up.
Yeah, somebody is fucking with my head.
And my head's already plenty fucked up all on its own.
Somehow I don't see Bryce walking into a sex shop.
What about ChlÃe? I don't know, she's in smart classes but she does stupid things.
I can't see her having any ideas.
- It's gotta be someone.
- Well whoever it is, it'll stop if you just tell the truth tomorrow.
How does that make any sense? Because they're doing it to protect Bryce.
And if you tell the truth, then there's no protecting him anymore.
Yeah, that sounds easy and simple.
- Well, I think it's what you have to do.
- I don't think you fucking get it, Alex.
Every time I look at him, it's like it's like it's happening all over again.
Right now.
Like it's gonna keep happening for the rest of my life.
Maybe this will make it stop.
- Clearly, I'm all alone in this.
- Jess [PHONE BEEPS] Everything cool? [COUGHS] Uh yeah, sorry.
That was just my mom being motherly.
- Your mom's kinda the Gestapo, huh? - Yeah.
I saw her watching from the window the other night.
- You You saw that? - They do know about me, right? Of course.
We've been friends since first grade.
Yeah, but I haven't seen them since, like, seventh grade.
And I've grown.
So have you.
Well, they know about you.
They do.
My mom was just saying that they want to have you over for dinner, so uh, we should do that at some point.
- You sure that's a good idea? - Did they know Hannah? Um No.
No, they didn't.
You never told them about Hannah but you've told them about me? All these secrets, Clay.
I mean, I told them about Hannah.
Eventually.
So you haven't told them about me because you're still hung up on her.
[STAMMERS] No, that has nothing That's why you were in court yesterday.
- How did you know that? - Tyler Down told me.
Because I asked him.
And I stood super close to him.
He got all nervous and told me the truth.
Yeah, um I'm not going back.
It was just one time.
You keep saying that, like it'll make it true.
- I'm not going back! - Relax.
I'm messing with you.
Here, eat.
[SPUTTERS] - Ugh! That tastes like pasture.
- Meat is murder.
- Ugh.
- [CHUCKLES] So is choking a person to death with weeds.
I like her.
She makes you try new things.
That's good for you.
I'm serious.
Okay? You seem less afraid when you're with her.
I like it.
And it also makes me kind of sad.
[SKYE] Is everything okay? Totally.
But you're not here with me.
I am here.
Promise.
Honestly, that's the truth.
It was just a game.
- Truth or dare.
- [SONYA] Maybe.
Or maybe it was more.
For Hannah.
Maybe Hannah suggested the game to take advantage of you.
Take advantage of Why? - Because she liked you.
- Objection.
Relevance? [SONYA] It goes to motivation, Your Honor.
[JUDGE] I'll allow it.
Is it just me, or is this whole locker room concept super antiquated? Like, just 'cause there aren't guys around doesn't mean it's not weird to get naked in front of strangers.
Yeah, totally.
[SONYA] Isn't that why she asked for your help? - No.
- Really? You said you're not a lesbian.
Can you be certain that Hannah wasn't? Hey, do you wanna maybe proofread each other's papers for Mrs.
Cusick's class? I barely passed the last one, saw you got an A.
- Sure.
Let's do it.
- [CHUCKLES] Courtney, you testified that when this picture got around campus, rumors were spread.
And these additional photos show that Hannah kissed you back.
- Is all of that correct? - Yes.
Then isn't it possible that Hannah had a crush on you? And when this picture got around, she was the one that spread the rumors, to put the suspicion on you? Isn't Hannah the real bully here? Courtney? - No.
- But if Hannah was the aggressor, doesn't it seem that she might have been a lesbian, or at least bisexual? And that she was using you? Isn't that possible? No, it's not possible.
Because it was the other way around.
I liked her.
I was the one with the crush.
[HANNAH] Mmm.
Maybe we should get back to the game.
- Sorry.
- No worries.
Like you said, it doesn't have to mean anything, right? Hey, what's wrong? - I feel stupid.
- What? Why? Because it does mean something.
To me.
Oh - Oh, I didn't, um - [SOBS] Oh, shit.
[COURTNEY] It was my first kiss, see? And I felt like it was ruined.
Hey.
Maybe 'cause her own first kiss had been ruined, maybe because she just felt bad, but that's the real reason she kissed me back.
That's what's in those photos Tyler took.
Proof.
That she was a good friend.
And maybe that means I was bullying her the whole time.
I don't know, but that's the truth.
- No further questions for this witness.
- [DENNIS] Redirect, Your Honor.
So, Courtney, you're saying, in fact, that Hannah didn't bully you that night.
That actually she was kind to you.
Yes.
Look, I didn't know Hannah that well, but that night, she was my friend.
She was there for me, and Liberty should have been there for her.
What a day.
It was a big win for us.
And for Hannah.
That poor girl, though.
That can't have been easy.
Well, she must have been carrying that around for a long time.
It's what happens when you bottle things up.
This room was always so sad and empty.
Do you know I've never lived alone? Huh.
I went right from my parents' house to a college roommate, and Andy.
[GASPS] Oh, Olivia.
Oh [OLIVIA] Um I'm so sorry.
I I forgot, I I put this in here.
I, uh This is the dress I was wearing the day I I found Hannah.
I always meant to wash it, but then I just couldn't bring myself to.
I'm so sorry.
I I used to carry one of Tessa's socks in my purse.
[SIGHS] For months after she died, I carried that sock everywhere.
- Do you still have it? - No.
No, eventually, I decided it was time to to move on.
Right.
No, that's that's probably what I should do, too.
[BRYCE] Hey, so, um So, what's up with you helping out Alex so much? Are you like his butler now, or what? [STAMMERS] Yeah, no.
It's nothing.
My mom's making me help him, because she's friends with his folks, and, yeah.
Huh.
So is he gonna testify? I don't know if he can, because of the - I mean, he's crippled.
- Right, right, right.
Yeah.
So when are you up? Couple days.
Oh, and my mom says thanks, by the way, for the lawyer.
- Yeah, sure.
- She - She said that you had already asked me? - Yeah, no, I meant to.
I just I figured it was better to act fast, you know? Yeah, no, that totally makes sense.
But so does that mean they called you in, too, or? No.
I'm just lookin' out for you.
- We're in this together, right? - Yeah.
I'm gonna catch up with you at practice.
My mitt's in the car.
So All right.
[SIGHS] What's their deal? I get that you're not called, but I still could be.
I have to be ready.
I need to know what was on those tapes.
Maybe it's better you only know what Jessica told you.
- Why? Why is everyone protecting me? - [BANGS] - What the fuck are you two looking at? - Hey, come on, buddy.
Come on.
- Alex, you need to calm down.
- You need to wake up.
You heard what happened to Courtney.
Who knows what Jessica's gonna do tomorrow? Okay? I can't I can't fail at this, too.
[COURTNEY] It's not always easy to know how to be a friend, but Hannah knew how and she was brave.
[CHLÃE] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six - [JESSICA] Sorry.
- [MUSIC STOPS] [CHLÃE] Okay.
That's okay, guys, um Everyone, take five.
[JESSICA SIGHS] - Hey.
- Hi.
- Is, uh Is everything okay? - Yeah, fine.
Okay, look, it's it's not.
And I'm just gonna say this, because that's what leaders do, right? [SIGHS] Look, um, I messed up yesterday.
I should've talked to you about Bryce, us dating.
I didn't realize how it might affect you, on the squad and and I'd hate for that to be weird.
"Weird"? I know that you and Bryce had a thing, but it's before my time, you know? And it's just one night.
I really do think it's so brave of you, coming back here after everything that happened.
"Everything that happened"? Yeah, you know, like, what everyone's saying.
That you cheated on Justin and called it rape, or whatever, 'cause you regretted it.
Which Hey, look, look, I totally I totally understand, because, you know, I should know, he's my man.
But I don't have a problem with it, so there's no reason why we should have to let that affect our work, right? [SIGHS] Oh, God.
Okay, Jessica, look.
I'm so Don't touch me! - [CHLOE SIGHS] - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Really? This is for yearbook? Don't you have windows to stalk, perv? Off with you! [MAN] I'm sorry, Tyler.
The decision is final.
[DOOR OPENING, CLOSING] What? What happened? Mr.
Kurtz just freaked out on me.
Apparently, I'm no longer allowed to photograph female sports.
This is how our school has decided to "respond" to my testimony.
By only letting you photograph the jocks who bullied you.
This school is king of irony.
Yeah, I don't really understand irony, exactly.
Yeah, no one really does.
Hey, so, um, did you make a copy of Hannah's tapes? Why? [STAMMERS] I mean, I thought about it.
For insurance, or whatever, but No.
[CLEARS THROAT] Well, thanks.
Sorry.
Hey, um Those pictures you took of me in the hospital um can I see them? Yeah.
Yeah.
Of course.
[KEYBOARD CLICKING] It's, uh it's a lot to take in.
Yeah.
[MOUSE CLICKING] Why did I do this to myself? You didn't do this.
Everyone else at this school did.
So, the credits from detention transfer 50 percent.
Depending on what your teachers say, you'll probably have to do summer school.
That's fine.
Um how does it feel being back? [SCOFFS] How do you think? I imagine it's been difficult.
But, um, I was hoping that you would tell me.
If you want.
It's only been half a day.
I mean, everyone stares, no one says anything.
Hmm.
Thinking about going back to cheerleading? - [SCOFFS] Are you kidding? - No.
Don't you know about what goes on at this school? Or at least have an idea? Yes, I do.
That's why I I want to help.
I think we both understand, too little, too late.
I hope it's never too late.
Sheri.
Why don't we schedule a check-in? [SCOFFS] Nah, I'm good.
But I'll be sure to stop by though, if I'm ever raped.
[ZACH] Good.
Nice.
Dude, your, your balance is totally better than last week.
One more big push.
Let's do this, come on.
[GRUNTS] - What's going on, man? - My legs don't work.
And my brain doesn't work.
My arms hurt.
- I'm a worthless piece of shit.
- Dude, come on.
No! Okay? It's true, man.
I can't help Jessica.
- I can't remember shit.
- Your memory Everyone that could help me remember won't.
- Your memory will come back, just - You're a fucking doctor now? How do you know that? What the fuck do you even know about what I'm going through? Why are you even here? Go hang out with the rest of your dumb jock fucking rapist friends.
[PANTING] I need a lift out of here.
- Ask your doctor.
- What is this? Some twisted physical therapy test? Yeah, okay, I don't know exactly what you're going through.
But I know what it's like to feel like shit's never gonna get better.
Every time I come home to my empty fucking house, I remember that feeling.
Zach, I forgot.
And I come here every single day because I remember last summer.
- It was PT that helped me get through it.
- I'm really sorry.
You know, I could still really use a lift out of here.
- [OLIVIA] Jackie! - Hmm? - You had no right! No right! - Olivia, I'm sorry, I thought you said Well, I didn't say! Okay? This was all I had left.
Everything else is in evidence, or donated, or gone.
Andy wanted to fucking get rid of everything.
And he did it.
And, Jesus, the clothes he wore that day, he washed them, and he wore them again! This [SOBS] My daughter's blood.
[SOBS] Oh, God.
Olivia, I am so, so sorry.
- I thought this was what you wanted.
- No! Don't! Just don't, don't I never would've dreamed, honestly.
I'm We were talking about that girl, on the stand, being bottled up, I just wanted to help.
You can't help with this part, okay? Because I'm not I'm not I'm not that girl.
And this part I have to do on my own.
I do.
Whatever's going to happen, I have to [SOBS] I have to do it in my time, in my way.
Yes.
I should - No.
No.
No, I - I should go.
["WOMAN IS A WORD" PLAYS] [COURTNEY] Instead of facing my fears and clearing up all the rumors, I let Hannah take the fall.
I was afraid of what people might think if they knew.
I'm only an image of what you see I'm only an image of what you see I'm only an image of what you see Courtney, some people might wonder, if you didn't tell the truth for so long, how do we know you're telling the truth now? Because it was time.
And because I owe it to Hannah.
[COURTNEY] And I guess we all have things we try to hide.
I'm only a woman if woman is a word But they can't stay hidden forever.
Bird to a bee, bird to a bee - [JESSICA] That was brave.
- Sorry? I read that blog.
What you did today, at court, it was brave.
- I don't know about that.
- No, it was.
- You helped Hannah.
- Yeah, but I hurt her first.
[STAMMERS] I told lies about her and I messed up her life.
You weren't the only one.
Did anyone threaten you before you testified? No.
Why? Did something happen to you? No, no, I Was it hard to tell the truth? Yes.
But it was time.
I'm only a woman if woman is a word Bird to a bee [COURTNEY] And I think this trial this trial is going to force a lot of people to tell the truth.
For better, or for worse.
- [PIANO MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY] - [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] - [MATT SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] - [SKYE CHUCKLING] Not a fan of the gluten free? Uh, hello? Mom? [MATT] Hey, kiddo.
Your mom's still at work.
We're in here.
[MATT SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] It's like gluten-free pasta.
It's like moisture-free water.
[SKYE AND MATT CHUCKLING] [SKYE] Sounds delicious.
- [CLAY] Guys, what's going on? - We're making hand-rolled pasta.
Your dad taught me.
Wait, check it! [DOUGH SPLATTERS] - [MATT] When it's done, it'll stick.
- Okay.
And why are we hand-rolling pasta? Skye said she liked Italian.
Figure it's the least we could do.
It's our first dinner together.
Your mom's thrilled, by the way.
Big points scored.
- Our first dinner.
- Clay, this was your idea, remember? - We talked about it at lunch.
- Um, yeah, that's not exactly - Skye, I think this might be ready.
- Yeah.
Okay.
You wanna try again? - Ready? - Yeah.
Try not to - Ooh, ow.
[PUFFS] - Okay.
- [POPS] - Hey! Oh, my God! Yes! - Bella, bella.
Molto bene! - [SKYE] Totally sticks.
[MR.
DOWN] That is graphic.
I don't know if I approve of this game.
Let's go again.
Dad, what is this? What? No, I wanna learn.
Well, at this rate, that's gonna take years.
[SCOFFS] Besides, I heard you on the phone with the school, earlier.
So, what's up? Well, I was wondering if maybe we should, um, transfer you to another school.
Really? But how would that look for colleges? Well, I really just want to make sure that you make it to college.
But, I mean, what about my friends here? - I have Alex.
He needs me, Dad.
- I know.
But Alex, he's recovering from a traumatic and I don't know if it's the healthiest thing for you.
- So, I can't hang out with him anymore? - No, but Is there no one else, you know, that you have a connection with? No, I do.
Actually, yeah, no.
[STAMMERS] I totally forgot.
Uh, Cyrus, in Mr.
Porter's class.
He's like an amazing artist.
And, you'd um, you'd like him.
- That's great.
- Yeah.
- Great! Bring him over.
- Cool.
We'll play some vids.
No one calls them that.
I call them that.
Okay.
[TODD] All right, here we go.
Yes.
Desert Hearts is supposed to be a classic.
The Kids Are All Right, Blue is the Warmest Color - Maybe we wait and watch this one last.
- Wha Isn't this just very binary thinking? Movies and shows are a wonderful way to open up a dialogue.
So we're screening one about a man who breaks up a lesbian couple? - Oh, God.
I forgot about that part.
- Yeah.
At least the lesbians aren't serial killers or policewomen.
And the male gaze makes Blue is the Warmest Color very suspect as fodder for positive conversation.
Good Lord, you overanalyze everything.
Probably why she didn't tell us before.
- Are you saying that it is my fault? - It's nobody's fault.
- Or it's my fault.
- Oh, no, no, no.
No.
- Honey, honey.
Aww.
Hey, sweetie - [SOBBING] Everyone takes the time they take.
[STEVE] Why are you crying? [SNIFFLES] It's nothing, it's [SIGHS] You're just amazing, and - I'm so lucky to have you both.
- Oh.
Come on.
Come here.
[WHISPERS] We love you.
[COURTNEY] The truth can free you if you let it.
[LAINIE] So it's graffiti? It's a It's a mural, Mom.
It's called street art.
It's very popular.
It's one of the oldest art forms.
If you think about it, cave paintings were street art.
- Yeah.
Yes.
- That's Thank you, Dad.
And, um, how long have you two been making this art? - Couple months.
- Not long.
Months! This must be some mural.
[CHUCKLES] - Well, we don't always paint.
- No? You don't? You're gone for hours, Clay.
What else are you doing? - Yeah, what else do we do, Clay? - We, um - We hang out.
Mostly.
- What does that mean? I never know.
Is that slang for sex? - Mom! - That's "hook up," honey.
Hook up, yes.
Well, if you two are, um, hooking up I just hope you're being careful.
We, uh aren't.
Hooking up, I mean.
We're, uh So all good.
- Yep.
- Okay.
Um should we can we be excused? What's gotten into you? We're in the middle of dinner.
- Nothing, I'm just full.
- Yeah.
This pasta is filling.
Yeah, it was so good, though.
- So good.
- So thank you, guys.
Appreciate it.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- Thanks for dinner, guys.
- Bye.
- You guys are the best.
Thanks.
Jesus, what is your? Holy shit.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [MAN] Don't forget to breathe.
- I am breathing.
- You're not, so much.
[GRUNTS] Wow.
That's some hard hits today.
You got something on your mind? [PANTS] Nah, I don't.
I just need you to sign this form for my probation officer.
Right on.
Six more sessions left.
Not bad.
Think your anger's been adequately managed in our time together? Huh.
I'll let you know.
We gotta get in the ring before you're done.
You and me.
Uh I don't think so.
But thank you.
She washes one dress and it sets me back five months.
I swear, I was ready to kick her out right then and there.
But I think she might be a friend, and I don't have many of those right now.
- Present company excluded.
- No, I get it.
Friends who aren't in high school.
[CHUCKLES] You know, Andy Andy used to tell me, when I'd listen to the tapes for the umpteenth time, and I would call you with new questions, he would say how inappropriate it was that I was spending time with you.
Really? You didn't tell him that I don't play for your team? What happened to that boyfriend of yours? The handsome guy? I haven't seen him around in weeks.
- Brad.
- Brad.
Yeah, we broke up.
Oh.
That's too bad.
- He was pretty.
- Yeah.
He didn't talk much, but he was very pretty.
What happened? Um He didn't want to date a kid anymore.
Wanted bigger things.
He was tired of the high school bullshit.
Here I am, bringing you more high school bullshit, huh? No, never.
I'm here for you, always.
God, I sit in that courtroom, Tony, and I feel like I never knew my daughter.
She kept all these secrets.
Why did she have so many secrets? I think, uh I think, sometimes, we aren't keeping secrets to hide from other people.
I think, sometimes, we're keeping them to protect those people.
[SOFT ROCK SONG PLAYS] - [SKYE] What's wrong? - [CLAY] Nothing.
- Okay, just stop.
- Wait, I Stop.
Just - Are you ashamed of me? - What? Skye, no.
I Then what the fuck is going on here, Clay? I mean, why didn't your parents know about me? Because they're my parents.
They meddle.
Honestly, it has nothing to do with you.
- Really? - Yeah.
It doesn't have to do with the way I look? Or that I have, like, tattoos and piercings and, like, cuts all over? Jesus, Skye, no.
I don't care about that stuff.
You know that.
- You don't care.
Of course.
- Wait Skye, hang on.
Let's just That's not what I meant, okay? What I mean is, I like the way you look.
I like you.
Really? Because your body is kinda saying the opposite.
Maybe my head's still scrambled from you trying to jerk me off in front of my parents.
Well, I'm sorry! I'm sorry for trying to be fucking spontaneous! You could've talked to me, you didn't have to just show up at my house.
It was weird! I'll tell you what's weird: you still being in love with a fucking dead girl.
Don't - Don't say that, please.
That's not true.
- Really? You freaked out at our spot last night the day that her case is going to trial.
Then you freaked out at lunch today because I brought up you going to court.
It's like, wherever we go, she's there! No.
That's not that's insane.
[SKYE AND HANNAH] Is it? It's all about Hannah, Clay, and it always will be.
How am I supposed to compete with that? She's perfect.
And she's dead.
- Really, Skye.
Can we sit and talk? - I don't wanna fucking sit down! Tell me I'm wrong.
Tell me you love me.
Tell me you're over her, then.
I I love you.
I And? And you're over me.
Clay, it's okay, just say it.
- Clay? - I can't! [SIGHS] I'm sorry, but I can't say that.
You have been lying to me, you fucking liar! Skye! Skye! Shit.
Skye! Skye.
- [BIKE STARTING] - Skye.
[MOTOR REVVING] Fuck.
- [HANNAH] What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna go after her.
- You sure that's a good idea? - No.
I think it's a terrible idea.
But a worse idea is staying here and discussing it all with you, so You think that's what she wants, for you to chase her? Are you serious right now? Are you fucking serious? "Part of me was saying, 'Don't go.
'" Remember that, Hannah? Your words.
My tape.
- "Part of me was saying, 'Don't go.
'" - I remember.
Well, there you go.
She's not me, Clay.
No.
No one is.
I think it projects strength and confidence, don't you? Maybe we can pull your hair back a little? Something like this? Sure, Mom.
Whatever you think.
[MOTHER] Want to sleep in your own bed tonight? - You must be getting tired of our floor.
- No.
No, I'm not.
Okay.
[COURTNEY] Or fear of the truth can keep you trapped in your secrets.
[SONYA] In discovery, the plaintiffs found that your date book was missing a page, which seems to be the page from the last date of your meeting with Hannah.
- Hmm.
- I'm not gonna ask you why that page is missing.
Not now, not in court.
But they will.
Well, I heard you made Courtney Crimsen come out on the stand today.
That's that's messed up.
I didn't make her do anything.
I just asked the questions I had to ask.
They're kids.
They're children.
They knew what they were doing.
Did you? [COURTNEY] And someone who's keeping a secret who's desperate to keep that secret, and desperate to stay hidden can hurt everyone around them.
There will always come a time when we're forced to face the thing we're most afraid of.
No, no, no.
No.
Skye! Skye! Wait, Mrs.
Miller! What is she - What happened? - Nothing that hasn't happened before.
- I didn't mean to upset her.
- She's not upset.
She's ill.
Please, just just go home.

I'm still waiting for Hannah Baker.
Who? Skye Miller.
I'm here for Skye Miller.
She's still in recovery.
They'll move her up here in a few hours.
That's what the other nurse said every hour for the past seven hours.
Kid, go home.
Come back in the morning.
Will she be okay? Look, I just need to know.
Go home.
Come back.
I'm still waiting for Hannah Baker.
Hannah Baker Clay, it's five o'clock in the morning.
What the hell is going on? Skye is my girlfriend.
But we haven't had sex, although we tried.
She's in the hospital right now, but not because she tried to kill herself.
Someone just ran me off the road on my way home.
Random? Maybe.
Who knows? I can't explain any of it to you because I don't understand it myself.
Now, does knowing all this make this any better or worse for you? Our agreement was that we'd talk about these things.
When the house is on fire, do you discuss the fire or get out of the goddamn house? Oh.
I need a fucking car.
I don't blame Hannah for anything.
That's how it is for girls.
People judge you by the way you look, the things they hear about you.
They put a label on you.
I just feel like boys get to define themselves.
They get to choose their identity, and they can hide behind it.
Well, most boys.
I think some know what it's like to be afraid to feel like the world gave you a certain label that you have to live with for the rest of your life.
But most boys don't know what it's like.
Every single girl does.
Your hair.
You always tell me how much you like it when it's straight.
Oh, Jess, you are beautiful either way.
Honey, I know this is all very frightening, but you'll do right by Hannah as long as you tell the truth.
- You are not on trial, don't forget that.
- Yeah, Mom, I know.
Even boys who mean well want to tell you who you are.
Hi.
Hi.
I, uh, I saw your mom heading for the cafeteria, so I took my chances.
- I told her it wasn't your fault.
- Isn't it a little bit my fault? No.
I brought you flowers.
Which now seems, uh, like, a little wrong? I don't know.
Maybe I should've gotten you a stuffed thing.
This place has a stellar gift shop.
What happened to your face? Uh, stupid bike thing.
I tried to cut through some trees in the dark.
It doesn't matter.
You matter.
Are you okay? My mom just freaked out.
It was not serious.
It was surgery.
It was stitches, mostly.
- We had a deal.
- It was a stupid deal.
You told me cutting didn't mean you wanted to die.
I don't wanna die.
I told you that and you don't understand.
- Then help me.
- I can't.
Because I don't understand it either.
It's like I have all of these feelings, and I can't control them, like I'm a visitor in my own mind.
And if I don't catch my breath, I'll burn up and blow away.
And I know you wanna save me from that, and I love you for it, but you can't.
Then what can I do? You can figure out your own shit, and I will figure out mine.
Apart.
Wait, you're you're breaking up with me? I'm sorry.
I love you.
I know.
That's That's why I'm telling you to go.
- This isn't fair.
- We have to be done, Clay.
I'm sorry.
I'm not just going to disappear from your life.
You already do.
You You think about Hannah, and you disappear.
So just do it for real this time.
So we just start expecting them to put a label on us.
Dyke! Hey, gay girl! Gross! - Lesbo! - Lesbian! And we just do it to ourselves.
Welcome to the team.
Don't start with me, Ryan.
Hey, it happens when you're ready.
I came out when I was five.
I didn't really have a choice.
Guess I was just born fabulous.
- I'm just glad you made it out.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
If you start driving a Subaru and wearing flannel, I will hold an intervention.
Be warned.
- Holy shit, Alex.
- Yeah.
Who's doing this? - Hey, can you tell whose handwriting? - Jesus, put it down.
Sorry.
I just - I'm really sorry, Alex.
- So you're not alone in this.
Sorry I said that.
That was really shitty, I'm just - This is just a lot.
- I get it.
I know.
Wait, your hair is different.
- It's court hair.
- I don't like it.
Noted.
What the hell happened to your face? Someone ran me off the road last night.
Someone in what looked like a black Range Rover.
- Bryce.
- You're not testifying.
- Does he know that? - I don't think it matters.
Whoever it is, they're coming after all of us.
This came in the mail for me yesterday.
- Jesus.
- This is nuts.
- We have to fucking stop him.
- How? I'm a cripple and you'll get grounded for life if you even speak to him.
Yeah, I promised my mom I'd stay away from him.
But if he's coming after me, then what can I do? - What up? - What's up, guys? Are we even sure it's him? Your boy keeps looking at you, Zach.
- Does he need his diaper changed? - Shut up, Monty.
Why don't you go take care of him? Dempsey, it's normal for nurses to fall for their patients.
Fuck off.
I don't even like him, okay? Right.
It's just your mom who makes you carry his books and wipe his ass.
No, the ass he does for pleasure.
What if it's Zach? That's crazy.
He's been helping you with everything.
Then why's he still hanging around Bryce? It's Bryce or someone protecting him.
He doesn't want the truth to come out.
- Why are you guys both looking at me? - Um Mostly 'cause you're sitting across the table from us? You can tell them what happened to you in court.
Hannah's lawyers told me I'm just supposed to talk about the Hot or Not List and how it ended our friendship.
But you know that's not true or it's not all that's true.
- And they know it.
- But it's not part of the case.
If you say it, it'll make it part of the case.
So I just say it? Jess, I Listen.
I know it's not easy, okay? Like, in no fucking universe do I think that, but If you tell the truth when they ask you about your friendship, if you tell them the real reason you stopped speaking to Hannah, then the truth is out.
And this shit stops.
And Bryce gets what's coming to him.
- I gotta get to first.
- Jess You know, the truth doesn't always make things right.
You should know that better than anyone.
Look, I need to remember what happened.
I need the tapes.
You have to stop protecting me.
- Skye's in the hospital.
- What? What happened? I stopped protecting her.
Okay, fine.
Then do this for me.
Get me a ride to court today.
- Alex - Clay.
Jessica! Wow.
Oh, my God, you look amazing.
- I love your hair.
- Yeah, thanks.
Oh, that's right, you have court today.
Good luck, you'll be great.
- Listen, about yesterday - It's fine.
We're good.
Cool.
'Cause we girls have to be strong together, you know? Own our own shit.
- I'm sorry if - No, no, no, right.
I get it.
Okay.
Well, we'll miss you at practice today.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- Good luck! Sometimes it seems like no matter what you do What's going on? people still see you the way they want to.
Who did this? Hey, are you okay? What? Why are you following me? Just leave me alone.
You think she'll talk? - Why would she? - Why did you? Don't you get tired of hiding, Marcus? Don't you wanna tell the truth sometimes? There's more than one truth.
No, I don't think there is.
- More press today.
- You know, you can talk to them.
I don't think so.
The longer you wait, the harder it is to reclaim the narrative.
- It's not my style, Jackie.
- You can make it your style.
You speak for Hannah now, and thousands of girls like her.
Jessica Davis will show up for Hannah.
She's a good kid.
And she's been very open about the culture of sexism at the school.
Most importantly, she's Hannah's friend.
But even when things get really tough all it takes is just one friend to get you through it.
Asshole.
Hey.
If you're lucky, you find more than one.
Toby, Eric, Chad, this is Tyler, my fellow ASS-class colleague and extreme outcast.
- What up? - Hey, Tyler.
- Yo.
- You shoot film? Super retro.
Yeah.
Uh I don't know.
There's something to holding a picture, like feeling it, I don't know.
Yeah.
No, like, um, flipping through a photo album instead of swiping on your phone.
Yeah, exactly.
- Uh, I'm Tyler.
- Oh, I know.
Mackenzie.
Quiet, freaks.
You find friends who see through the labels.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
- Thanks for the ride, Tony.
- Oh, I'm coming in with you guys.
But you're on the witness list.
They check it.
No, I got my brother's ID.
I haven't slept in two nights.
I just wanna know what I'm looking at in there.
What if you're on the list? I'll just wave my cane and cry.
It works everywhere.
Wait.
I bet there's a handicapped entrance.
Don't think you're supposed to say "handicapped.
" - Take my arm.
- Fuck you both.
I found those friends.
That list just messed up everything.
And was this list typical of your experience at Liberty? Yes.
Hannah was already labeled a slut.
That list just made everything worse.
The truth didn't matter.
That's just what they do to girls at our school.
I mean, I found these just this morning, in my math class Objection, these photos were not admitted into evidence They take one photo and it defines you, and then it becomes your job to prove everyone wrong.
This is what they did to Hannah, and now they're doing it to me! Order! Order! I can't believe he let them in.
Well, they're inflammatory, but they're relevant.
Dennis.
She's the girl on tape nine.
Ask her.
I know she is.
I can't ask her that, Olivia.
It's not relevant.
It's as relevant as the pictures.
It shows how the boys treated the girls at that school, and that the school knew about it.
But it didn't happen at school.
And Bryce isn't on trial.
All right, both parties will allow these photos, now Plaintiff's Exhibit 12, into evidence.
- Ms.
Struhl.
- Miss Davis, did you report these photos? - No.
- So you're telling me that you expect the school to take action to protect you, but you don't tell them when an incident they're supposed to protect you from even occurs? If I felt like I could trust the school, maybe I would have.
Maybe Hannah would have.
Oh, that's right.
She did, and look what happened.
Move to strike as non-responsive.
The jury will disregard the witness's last answer.
Miss Davis, did you report the Hot or Not List? - No.
- Because, in fact, it wasn't the list that broke up your friendship, was it? It was.
Do you know who put your name and Hannah's name on the list? - Yes.
- Who? Alex Standall.
And isn't it true that Alex Standall was your boyfriend and that Hannah was jealous of that? No.
We were all friends at first.
For a while, if you saw one of us, you saw all three of us.
If you're waiting for, like, the perfect moment to choreograph your first kiss, you're gonna die a virgin.
- I just want it to be special.
- Your standards are way too high.
You need to lower them like the rest of us.
Okay, wait.
Never have I ever never been kissed.
- Too soon.
Too soon.
- Drink, Hannah.
- It's Sprite.
- It's fake Sprite.
- It's Twist Up, actually.
- Your mom is so cheap.
- That's so rude! - What the fuck kind of name is Twist Up? When did this become a game? Okay.
Never have I ever kissed my best friend.
And I don't really like this generic shit, so Well, uh, we're all best friends.
Our relationship started heating up.
- I swear - Oh, shit.
- What are you doing, crazy? - I thought she was off Wednesdays.
But I tried to be sensitive to Hannah.
- Let's go to Monet's.
- Oh, my God, relax.
She's not into me, Jess.
Ever hear of girl code? It doesn't matter if she's into you.
So, what are we doing? I'll show up first, you wait, like, three minutes.
And when Hannah tells you I'm inside, just be like, "Oh, my God, small world.
" - Okay? - Seriously? Ninth row.
I'll see you in there.
- Okay, I get the aisle.
- You wish.
But of course, he didn't wait.
He didn't get what it would feel like for a girl.
- Yeah, we're just, uh, hanging out.
- Together.
So I see.
Ten dollars, please.
Thanks.
Hey, if you want, we can go grab coffee together afterwards.
Oh, uh, I don't want to intrude.
Intrude? Like you'd ever.
Jess, we're gonna miss the trailers.
Go.
Enjoy the movie.
I You know, we can catch up whenever.
Jesus, you're always putting me on the spot.
Fuck girl code.
Hannah's above all that shit.
I guess.
- She seemed cool, right? - Yes! Can we just enjoy our first real date, please? Actually, Hannah was pretty okay with it.
Even though I chose a boy over my friendship with a girl.
- Thanks.
- So, when did you two start Um, I don't know.
Not that long ago.
After we all hung out at her house that night, I guess.
So, after we all kissed, you just picked her? It's not like that.
We just We have more in common.
So, what, are you trying to have sex with her now or something? What? No.
Why is that any of your business, anyway? Well, because a few weeks ago, we were best friends, sharing all our secrets, and now, apparently, you guys have all these new secrets that I'm not a part of.
Not everything's about you, Hannah.
I was wrong about Hannah being cool with us dating.
She, like, lost her shit at the snack bar.
She's totally jealous, like, obsessed.
- Shut up, really? - Yeah.
- What did she say? - A lot.
She's hurt.
But, Jess, I don't want to break up over someone else's drama.
Never.
But we should probably just, you know, back off until she gets over it.
- Shh! - Yeah.
- Here.
- Thank you.
From that point, Alex and I kept things cool.
But when Hannah found out that he made that list, it was too much for her.
So you blame the Hot or Not List, and the culture at Liberty, but isn't it true that it was Hannah's jealousy that ended your friendship? No.
It was the list.
After you broke up with Alex, did your friendship with Hannah resume? - No.
- Because you started - dating Justin Foley, correct? - No.
So you didn't date Justin Foley? - No, I did - Hannah was jealous of you and Justin, just like she was jealous of you and Alex, wasn't she? - No, that's not true.
- How do you know? - Jessica, how do you know? - How do you know? Jessica, isn't it true that Hannah Baker was jealous, and vindictive, - and that is why your friendship ended? - No.
Well, the prosecution claims that it was the Hot or Not List, but it was simply Hannah's own jealousy, isn't that correct? There's no other reason, is there? Jessica.
Jessica? Is there any other reason that we haven't mentioned? No.
There's no other reason.
I see.
No further questions.
- I gotta go.
- You're leaving? She's not done.
I heard enough.
- Yeah, me, too.
You coming? - I'll leave when Jess is done.
Did you really kiss Hannah? Yeah.
It was a friend thing.
- I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
No, Hannah was my friend, I just wanted to help her.
You did, honey.
You did.
Jessica.
Is there - Is there something you wanna tell me? - What? We've all been so focused on Hannah, maybe we should be worried about you.
- No, no.
I'm I'm fine.
- I've listened to the tapes.
I I've listened to the tapes.
I'm sorry, I I should go.
Jess.
I can't do it.
- What can I do to help? - You can leave.
Hey, excuse me, I'm looking for Skye Miller.
I was here earlier.
- She's been transferred.
- To another floor? - Another facility.
- What? Where? Look, kid, I'm sorry.
I can't tell you that.
Only family.
Why do you assume that her family gives more of a shit about her than I do? I don't assume that.
The laws do.
Right.
She's safe.
It's a good program.
Which you can't tell me anything about.
For what it's worth, what she's going through isn't about you.
You're not the first boyfriend to sit here all night, wondering what he did, when it wasn't him at all.
It's not your fault.
Give her some space, kid.
And give yourself a break.
You've reached Skye, leave a message.
Skye.
Uh, it's me again.
I I went by your house, but no one was home.
Where are you? Where did they send you? Like, I just Please just let me know you're okay.
I promise, I'm not trying to talk or anything.
I just I need to know you're all right.
Okay? Bye.
I'm sorry about Skye.
- No, you're not.
- I am.
Every day, it's something new with you.
Something I didn't know.
First it was the Tyler thing and now you've kissed, like, half the school.
- Seriously, you believe that? - Justin, Courtney, Alex - And you.
- Yeah, I remember, thank you.
So what, your feelings are hurt and you're angry at me and angry at Jessica, you miss Skye, and the whole fucking world is unfair.
That sums it up pretty well.
You're not the guy to sit on his hands and wait for someone else to save the day.
What else can I do? I got his fucking confession, Hannah.
And I had to go to the hospital, did we discuss that yet? The fact that I was shitting blood the next night? My mom wanted to go after him for beating the shit out of me, except I went to his house to buy drugs, and I'd just gotten suspended for drugs, so can't do that.
But that was okay, because I had his confession.
Right? What's a little internal bleeding when you can take down a rapist? And then the school heard it, and all the lawyers heard it, and no one did a goddamn thing.
Because there's no evidence, there's no DNA.
They just have your accusation, and you're I'm dead.
- He's gonna get away with everything.
- But he doesn't have to.
Don't do nothing because you're pissed off.
Okay? Or afraid.
Or sad.
Don't let Bryce get away with it.
You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Look, Jessica is evidence that the problem is getting worse.
Her testimony was strong.
Trust me, the jury heard me on the redirect You know what else the jury heard? That my daughter is a jealous slut.
And that's just today.
You think they're gonna forget that? Ms.
Baker, Austin James with the Evergreen County Register.
- We've been live-blogging the trial - I know who you are.
Yesterday you wrote that my daughter is an "exhibitionist with low self-esteem.
" - Olivia - Let her speak.
Well, it sounds like that "exhibitionist" had a rough go of it at Liberty High.
Sounds like she could have used a friend.
But that girl is not my daughter.
Okay, that is not the real Hannah Baker, okay? That is a character that the defense attorney created, a girl whose life meant so little, apparently, that her classmates can't even speak about her.
Hannah was not a liar or a slut or a mean girl.
She was a good friend, and she had her friend's back.
The problem is no one had hers.
I understand.
Olivia, what about you? Her friends didn't have her back.
Did you? That's enough.
Come on.
Do boys have it easier? I think so.
I don't know.
Motherfucker! You know his slider fucks with me, Dempsey! Quit calling that shit.
- That wasn't a slider, dude.
- You're fucking with me.
- Curve all the way.
- Really? - The fuck is my problem? - I think we both know, man.
No.
This doesn't have shit to do with her, okay? My mom told me you got called to testify for the school.
- My fucking mom - Why didn't you tell me? Didn't want it announced to your new best friend.
Alex and I, we're not tight like that.
We don't talk about shit that matters.
- Who else knows? - My parents.
Our lawyer.
Hey, if you guys want to suck each other's dicks, - there's a place for that, you know? - Yeah.
Monty's house.
Nobody else needs to know.
I got your back.
- Yeah.
No, I know that, man.
Thank you.
- Got you.
- You've had quite a year.
- Hmm.
Yeah.
You can say that.
- Two suicides.
- One.
One attempt.
And he's on the road to recovery.
Everyone around here is watching that trial.
Parents holding the school responsible We are responsible, aren't we? To an extent.
But there are limits.
Mm.
Yeah, there are always limits.
Have you considered holding off on the job search until the trial's over? Yes.
But I have a family to support.
And I'm a heck of an educator.
And I care about kids.
Why not stay at Liberty? I was hoping to to do better.
Find a place where I can make a difference, you know? Make kids' lives better.
There's only so much we can do, though, right? We can't go online, we can't go home with them every night.
We only have those kids for a few hours a day, we can't be everywhere.
Yeah, I used to think that, but I don't think that anymore.
I think we can try.
Thank you for your time.
I told you we should've pulled her from that school.
Then what? Keep her home for the rest of her life? We can't rely on the school.
If we can't trust our own daughter to come to us when she's being harassed, how can we protect you, Jessica? - Jessica? - What? Honey, why didn't you tell us that you were being harassed? I don't know.
What about the group? Can you talk to one of the other survivors? God, Dad, I hate that word.
Survivor? I'm just me.
I'll get it.
I was flashing back to the police station.
When my dad made me go, after I told him about that night.
And I told them I couldn't remember who did it.
I couldn't tell them it was Bryce because I knew they wouldn't believe me.
But that's not true.
We believe you.
If you go to the police, we can back you up You can't.
You weren't there.
Hannah's gone, and she was sweet and sensitive and white.
Look at what they're doing to her.
Don't you get it? I'm not the right kind of victim to go against Bryce Walker.
- Not when it's his word against mine.
- What if Justin were here? What if Hannah were here? She's dead, and Justin might as well be.
Have you heard from him? I'm tired of talking about this, Clay.
I'm tired of thinking about it every second of every day.
- I know.
- No, you don't.
You have no idea.
I'm tired of staring at my closet, wondering what people are gonna think.
Wondering what I can wear that'll cover the most skin.
What I can hide in.
Oh.
I need a finer dice on those onions, Tyler.
Sorry, my mom usually does this stuff.
- I don't really know what I'm doing.
- Give it, give it, give it.
Huh, huh, huh.
Huh, huh, huh.
Mothers who baby their sons raise men ill-equipped for life.
It's a patriarchal tragedy.
No, what's tragic is Liberty fucking High School.
- Right? - Today we had a sub in ASS-class and she took your copy of The Lottery because it "glamorizes violence.
" What? She must not have read it closely.
That's the thing.
She hasn't read it.
- What? - It's the Liberty way.
Yep.
Ban books, and celebrate guys who can hit a baseball real hard.
I went through the same bullshit.
Yeah? - Scapegoating, mob mentality.
- Yeah, I should've fought back.
Kinda hard to do when you have no power.
Who says you have no power? - The world? - Well, don't listen to the world.
If you don't fit into one of their boxes, they wanna punish you, but don't let them.
- Real heroes fuck shit up.
- Mm.
More like resist.
But yes.
- Hi.
- Oh, glad you could join us.
Oh, bite me, Cy-Cy.
- You're on salad duty.
- Okay.
- Hey, Tyler.
- Oh, hey.
- Sorry I'm late, Dad.
- That's all right.
- Oh, wait, so you're - Chronically late.
You'll get used to it.
Some are calling this lawsuit a witch hunt, but I have faith that our son will bring the same integrity and honesty that got him into Harvard into that courtroom tomorrow.
Dear Lord, please be with Marcus during his testimony.
We believe you will stand strong with us.
- We believe - Thank you so much, Dad.
Now let's get back to stuffing those envelopes.
All right? Election's less than two weeks away! A prayer? You don't have to worry, Dad.
I'm not worried about you.
I know you, but I also know how things go.
They can turn a victim into a villain, a monster into a martyr.
I promise.
It won't affect the election, Dad.
Really.
This isn't about the election, son.
It's about protecting you.
Look, the rules are different for us.
Look, just be smart, all right, be humble, and don't let them put words in your mouth.
- Just be you.
All right? - All right.
You still gotta breathe.
Fuck you.
If you can curse, you can breathe.
Hey, hey.
You still got ten minutes.
You're not just cheating yourself, you're cheating me.
And, you know, your probation officer.
- I'm sorry.
I gotta I gotta go.
- Hot date? - That's funny.
- Why is that funny? Uh - Because I got dumped last month.
- You? Got dumped? Believe it.
What kind of foolish woman would let you go? Foolish guy? Yeah, guy.
Well.
That is one foolish, foolish guy.
Why the fuck would I know anything about how to find someone in the city? I don't know, I mean, your brothers.
- I just thought - What? You'd ask your brown friend for help navigating the streets? What? No.
I mean, not entirely.
I mean, is that racist? I'm not racist.
Am I racist? Okay, don't go into your Clay-hole.
I'm not in the mood.
Look, I know we haven't, like, talked much these past months, and it felt like this whole thing was gonna be over.
But it's not over.
Okay, you wanna find Justin.
How do you know Justin wants to be found? He reached out to Jess.
- Really? - Yeah.
He sent her a postcard.
She doesn't know that I know, but if we find him, she'll have a witness.
And she can report Bryce.
And then what, we just deliver him to Mrs.
Baker so he can testify? Yeah.
I mean, that that's the goal.
And is that what she wants? How many times did she ask us about Bryce? About tape nine? She would've gone after Bryce if lawyers hadn't talked her out of it.
Yeah.
Okay, I can talk to my probation officer.
He deals with homeless kids and runaways and shit like that.
- Yeah, see? I knew you'd have a way.
- Oh? I'm just saying.
I don't recognize the face.
You try the city shelters? Been to five already.
Are you sure you haven't seen him? He might've been wearing, like, a blue varsity jacket.
- Um, he went to Liberty High School.
- Wait, jacket kid.
Okay, yeah.
He was just here a day or two, couple weeks ago.
Had an incident with one of the girls, we asked him to leave.
Can we Can we talk to her? You can try.
He got a bed night one, which never happens, but he went out and brought some cocky skater asshole from a squat back with him.
He started giving hassle to these two friends of mine who are together, calling them faggots and shit.
I got Lewis to bounce the skater kid for being overage.
We told Jacket he could stay, but he was loyal and he took off.
Haven't seen him since.
Any idea where the kid skates? Or squats? Jesus.
- People actually live here? - Apparently.
Come on.
Excuse me.
We're looking for a friend of ours.
Have you seen this guy? No.
- All right.
Thank you.
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
We're looking for a friend of ours.
Excuse me.
We're looking for a friend of mine.
This guy.
Have you seen him? Tony.
We look like narcs.
Okay.
Can you help me? - Tony.
- What? Can you spare some change? Incentive.
We need to offer incentive.
What do you have? I fucking drove.
You don't have cash? No, I'll pay you back tomorrow, with interest.
Come on.
Uh Have you ever seen this kid here before? Maybe.
Will $10 help you remember? I think 20 would help me remember more.
- There he is! - Justin! Yo, Foley! Foley! - Hey! Where'd you get that jacket? - What was that? You heard him, the jacket.
Where'd you get it? Goodwill.
The fuck is it to you? - Don't fuck with me, man.
- Okay, Tiny.
Whoa! Check it out! - Who the fuck do you think you are? - Tony! Waste my time and I will fucking end you, understand? - Tony, let go! - Where is he? He was sparing change on BART a couple weeks back.
- When's the last time you saw him? - Yesterday, in Chinatown.
- Damn! - That's our friend that belongs to.
- Tony, come on, let's go.
Let's go.
- What the hell? - Where did that come from? - Take the jacket.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
I think that's him.
- Jesus, that can't be him.
- Justin.
Wait! Justin! God damn it! Fuck.
Just You fucking kids! How many times do I have to tell you? Doing your drugs in my alley.
This is private property! I called the cops! Justin.
Justin! Jessica wants you back.
- Fuck you.
- No, she does.
- I just talked to her yesterday.
- She hates me, okay? No, she doesn't.
She wants you to come back.
I will leave both of you if you don't get in my fucking car now! Good evening.
Um, Mrs.
Walker, I'm Kevin Porter from Liberty High School.
I know who you are.
I didn't realize you made house calls.
I would like to talk to you about your son, and his interaction with girls at Liberty High School.
My husband isn't home.
Okay.
Come in.
- Can I get you something to drink? - No, thank you.
And I left a few messages at your house until your mom picked up and told me to stop calling.
So Anyway, um Look, I hope I find you.
And I won't call you back again.
- I mean, I might call you back.
- I'll probably call you back.
Okay.
Bye.
In my experience, a girl who doesn't call you back - is a girl who doesn't wanna talk to you.
- Really? You're gonna tell me about your experience? Look, all I'm saying is that Skye Miller is a piece of work.
She's fucked up.
She's? I think you should stop talking, like, for the foreseeable future.
Good.
You're alive.
Drink.
- You're welcome.
- You'll feel much better after a meal.
- And a shower.
- Fuck you.
Your mom still live in the same place? - Shit, I can't go back there.
- What? Why? I took some money from her boyfriend before I left.
If he finds out I'm there, he'll kill me.
So what the fuck do we do with him? Friendship is a complicated thing especially between girls.
And it gets even more complicated when there's a boy involved.
But I can tell you one thing.
Hannah's totally Single White Female-ing you right now.
I blame the boy more than I blame Hannah.
Does that work if one of us is brown? - Just ignore her.
That's what I do.
- Oh, shit.
- Here she comes.
- Good luck with that.
Bitches.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So - You were pretty drunk the other night.
- Me and everyone else.
Fucking Jeff Atkins, I seriously cannot believe he would do that.
Yeah, well, maybe there's more to that story.
What do you mean? I just Uh, listen, Jess, I, um I saw something - when you and Justin went into - Jesus, Hannah, seriously? First Alex and now Justin? Look, I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry that I'm making it work with Justin and you couldn't.
It's not my fault.
Okay? - I'm - Jesus, some party.
Yeah, some party.
- It's so fucked up about Jeff.
- Yeah, it's all fucked up.
- But, Jess and I had a good night, huh? - Mm.
- What are you? - Hannah, enough, all right? Can you just let me and Justin be happy? Don't be a bitch.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry.
There are all different ways boys mess with girls.
And some of those ways, well, we let them do it.
Clay.
There's something we'd like to talk to you about.
Outside.
Coming.
Shit.
Clay, um We, uh, recognize that, um most kids, many kids your age in our area have cars.
Even though public transportation is excellent in this county.
We also recognize that riding on county highways may be safer from a car.
No way.
Wait, this is mine? That's - That doesn't make any sense.
- Agreed.
We want to show you that we trust you, Clay, to, uh to do the right thing, to be a grown-up, to make good choices, and to involve us in your life when appropriate.
Yes.
Yes, 100 percent.
I'm I'm hearing you.
Though, it's even easier to sneak around in a Prius.
They're silent.
No more sneaking around.
No more secrets.
I promise.
Make a sound, we're both dead.
Yeah, we're gonna connect that to the detonator.
- Yeah, just go Just like There we go.
- Oh, shit.
- Is that supposed to happen? - Yeah.
Yeah.
I think the kind of friends you have say a lot about the kind of person you are.
Oh, fuck, dude.
No, keep going.
Shit.
Shit.
- Hey, whatcha guys doing? - Jesus.
Get out! Working on a science project.
- Can I help? - Get out! If Tyler tells me to go, then I'll go.
Uh, uh, I, um Now! Fine, assholes.
Close the fucking door.
And Hannah, she was a true friend.
Better than I deserve.
We all want to be strong.
We all want to be the kind of people who deserve good friends.
But I guess, at the end of the day, none of us are as strong as we want to be.

1 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [ROCK SONG PLAYING] [MARCUS] My whole life, my father told me people will judge me.
Justin, wake up.
[MARCUS] People will assume they know who I am by looking at me.
Justin, come on.
We got to get you to Mrs.
Baker and the lawyers before court starts.
[MARCUS] And that the deck is stacked against me.
- Justin, get up! Come on.
- [JUSTIN GROANS] [SIGHS] - I'm not so sure he got the message.
- It's disgusting.
- He stinks.
- No, the clothes stink.
He's been living on the street for five months.
[SIGHS] [MARCUS] When you're faced with that, when you're without power, on the outside, you have tough choices.
- [LAINIE] You're up early.
- Hi! Uh Laundry.
Yeah.
- Is this new? - Yes.
It's, um, pre-distressed.
- Clay, is that your gym clothes? - Uh - 'Cause it smells - Yeah, um I left them on the bathroom floor last night, like I do, and you know, at night, my aim isn't so good.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Uh, your father had an early meeting, so it's just you and me for breakfast, okay? Okay, great.
Thanks, Mom.
[MARCUS] It's easy to hide.
To give in to the pain.
Like Hannah did.
She started to believe - that she was less than.
- [BANGING] Shit.
[TOILET FLUSHING] Tony, it was heroin.
I did, like, an image search and it came up black tar heroin.
He He had heroin.
[MARCUS] To believe that a life of privilege and position was only for other people.
You're up early.
You got Rodin coming over for a yoga lesson? No.
Just wanted to say good morning before you went off to practice.
Oh.
Why? [UTENSILS CLINKING] That girl's mother made a statement in the press, apparently.
Yeah? You haven't been following it? Uh, Dad and Warren told me to keep my head down, so, you know, that's what I've been doing.
So school's been fine, then? With all this drama? Yeah, yeah.
Everything's great.
You know, just gearing up for the season.
Let me know if you need someone to talk to.
Dr.
Pierce would be glad to see you.
Or your counselor at school.
What's his name? Mr.
Porter? No, thanks.
I'm good, Mom.
[SCOFFS] - All right, honey.
Have a great day.
- Yeah, you, too.
- Don't work too hard.
- Yeah.
[MARCUS] But the truth is, privilege is a trap all its own.
What the fuck? What are you doing here? Tony told me to wait till your mom left, then come through the window.
Did I mess it up? Uh, no, the window's right, but why did he send you? - Well, he thought I could help.
- Help with what? I've got some supplies.
How are you feeling? Fine.
Supplies for what? When is Tony getting here? He's not coming, Clay.
He's still on probation.
He can't risk getting involved now that he knows about Justin.
What about me? [EXHALES] All right, so the thing is, I was washing your clothes and I found your shit and I flushed it down the toilet.
And Tony thinks you might be an addict and we might have to detox you.
Fuck this.
I'm out of here.
Well, "A," all of your fucking clothes are in the wash, and "B," where are you gonna go? We're gonna get you through this.
Look, Justin, you want to help Jessica, right? You can't testify if you're high.
- Okay? - Justin.
Justin.
Jesus, what happened to you? You think Jessica will wanna see you like this? No.
[EXHALES] Shit.
I can't miss school.
Go.
I got this.
- I'll text you every hour.
- Why are you doing this, Sheri? I spent the last five months trying to make up for what I did.
And now that I'm out, I realize it's actually gonna take the rest of my life, so maybe this is where I start.
[JUSTIN GASPING] I think I, I think I ate too much breakfast.
[CLAY] Oh, fuck, Justin.
That's my bed.
[SIGHS] Do you know who might want to intimidate you, Jessica? I think it's pretty obvious.
It's the same guy who assaulted her in the fall and doesn't want her opening her mouth in court.
So, okay, if he's worried that you would call him out, that means he thinks that you know who he is.
Yeah, well, I don't.
Okay, even if you don't know for sure, maybe you've got a feeling? Or maybe someone else saw something that night.
Because if you're scared to come forward, for whatever reason, I want you to know that we're on your side.
You know, we can protect you.
And it's safe to tell the truth.
[MRS.
DAVIS] Honey, is there something else? [MR.
DAVIS] You can talk to us, baby.
And we're gonna get that bastard, you don't have to worry about that.
[MARCUS] And we do ourselves no favors by keeping our heads down, by hiding.
You have to find a way to hold your head up.
[MR.
COLE] Say hi to Trish and the kids.
All right, last call, I promise.
You good? - Yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah? Uh, yeah, you know, I'm just, like, a little nervous, I guess? Oh, my boy doesn't get nervous.
You're gonna be great.
Just tell them what you told the lawyers last fall.
- The truth will set you free, right? - Yeah, no, I know.
But, um But, Dad, like, what if they ask things that they didn't ask before? Like, what if they ask me to, you know, name names? - What names? - I don't know, Dad.
It's just Some of the other kids, they, um they called out, like, friends of mine.
Look, son.
You've worked hard to get where you are.
Harder than other people in the same position.
And relationships are important.
They're everything.
In any fair system, they wouldn't be putting you in a position to make impossible choices.
But it's not a fair system.
And I want you to look after yourself first.
Yes, sir.
You're gonna be great, okay? - [WOMAN] Justice for Hannah! - [INDISTINCT CLAMORING] [MARCUS] You have to find a way to belong in this world.
You have to find a way to be strong.
Hey, man.
Can I sit here? I don't exactly have the upper body strength to stop you, so Well, maybe if you showed up for PT yesterday, - could've worked on your left hook.
- Maybe I didn't feel like it.
Wouldn't you rather hang out with your actual ambulatory friends? Nah, no, I like my non-ambulatory friends.
Good for you, then.
[LAUGHTER ECHOING] - Hey, man, you okay? - Yeah.
No.
I just I remembered something.
Or I almost remembered it.
- We love you, Hannah! - Justice for Hannah! Oh, my God.
Look at them all.
What did I say? You spoke to them.
You showed them who Hannah really was and they heard you.
[CHUCKLES] [CAR DOOR CLOSING] - [DENNIS] Good morning.
- Good morning.
Your statement had quite the impact, clearly.
- I knew you'd be upset.
- I'm not upset.
They should hear from you at the right time.
People need to hear the whole story, Hannah's story.
- And they're not getting it in there.
- These kids are not on message.
These kids are kids, Jackie.
And they are the story.
We tell Hannah's story through them.
- This Marcus Cole - Is a little politician.
But he'd rather blame the school than himself, and I can work with that.
[MARCUS] When you're marginalized, powerless, you have to find strength somewhere.
In friends.
- Jess.
Jessica.
- Hey, Clay, what's up? We have Justin.
What? Over the weekend, Tony and I went down to Oakland.
But how did you know? You saw the postcard.
You fucking snooped through my room? He wants to help.
He said he'll testify, he's, um - a little too sick at the moment, but - What do you mean sick? From being homeless.
Look, he's at my house.
We're taking care of him.
- If you want to see him or - I don't.
Soon as he's better, gonna take him to the Bakers' lawyer.
- He can back up Hannah's story.
- It's not Hannah's story, and it's not his story, it's mine.
I don't want him telling it.
Jess, listen.
Listen to me.
- Justin wants to help.
- [WHISPERS] Shut up, Clay.
[ZACH] I'm just worried about it.
All right? I'm serious, dude.
No, I'm not kidding.
Ask your boyfriend for help with history.
Oh, wait.
He's brain damaged.
You're just jealous he had a brain to damage, Monty.
Guys, if I don't ace this test, I might drop below a C, okay? So play the dad card again.
Metcalf will let you slide.
It's not a card, dude.
No, I know.
Fuck, sorry, brother.
You know what I mean.
If ChlÃe hadn't stopped doing study group I'm sorry, Zach.
I've just been so busy with everything.
Yeah, "everything," meaning doing Bryce.
[HISSING] Hey, well, it's Zach's fault.
- He set us up.
- Yeah.
I gave him your number.
The rest of it isn't my fault.
- Meaning what, exactly? - Meaning I have to get to class.
What's going on there, Walker? He's just got a lot on his mind.
I don't blame him.
["FREEZE ME" PLAYING] Tell me what you think Are we in trouble? Feelin' sorry's Never really been my struggle Pickin' up the pieces Siftin' through the rubble [MARCUS] When you feel left out, when you feel like this high school world is against you, it can be lonely and frightening.
I wouldn't want anyone to feel that way.
Which is why I signed up for Dollar Valentines, and why I invited Hannah out.
And was there a reason you chose Hannah in particular? I knew that she'd had some tough times at school.
It was her first year.
I wanted to show her that there were good kids at Liberty.
Who'd you guys get? Anybody good? Nope, not really.
[LAUGHS] I see what's up, Dempsey.
Just looking for a sure thing? Yeah, not worth it, Zach.
Hannah Baker is a lot to handle.
Yeah, I heard she plays rough.
[LAUGHTER] Yeah, like you would know, Marcus.
Yeah, aren't you saving it till marriage or something? Isn't Jesus your one true love? [CHUCKLES] I mean, doesn't mean I can't cheat now and then.
And it just so happens I got Hannah, so maybe it's time to sin.
Oh.
[LAUGHS] You know what? I'll bet you a hundred bucks you can't even get your hands in.
I'll take that bet.
Well, maybe we underestimate you, Minister Marcus.
Maybe you do.
[MARCUS] So I asked her out on a date.
Hannah Baker.
Guess what? Hey, Marcus Cole.
What? You were first on my list for Dollar Valentines.
[MARCUS] She seemed excited.
Grateful for the attention.
A little sad.
Do you even like Hannah? Or are you just trying to get with her? Yes, I do like her.
And I made a bet with Bryce.
What is your deal? Some days you're this serious person with legitimate plans for the world, and the next, you're, like, this stupid guy.
Like, one day you're Hillary, the next day, Bill.
Yeah, and which one was president? You do what you gotta do to get on in this world.
Especially if you ever want to get something done.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean you have to be friends with Bryce.
Yeah, it does.
[MARCUS] We met at Rosie's Diner.
And at first it seemed like things were going really well.
What are you doing? I mean, she seemed like she was having a good time.
- Come on.
- No.
And so, at some point, I tried to hold her hand.
But I guess she took it the wrong way.
- And why do you say that? - She yelled at me.
Don't touch me! Get off! - [MARCUS] Pushed me out of the booth.
- Hey, what the fuck! - [DENNIS] Because you touched her hand? - Yes.
I mean, if a young woman yells at you and physically pushes you off of her, don't you think she might have felt threatened or unsafe? Objection.
Speculation.
Withdrawn.
I'll rephrase.
Marcus, did you at any time ask Hannah why she pushed you out of the booth? No.
[MARCUS] I was confused.
I left right after that.
And in the days that followed, did you talk to anyone about your date with Hannah? I was hurt after I got rejected Come on, dude.
So I vented to some of my friends about it.
- You couldn't keep it up, Marcus, huh? - Oh, shut up, dude.
[MARCUS] I never should have said anything.
Nah, nah, man, look.
She wants everybody to think she's DTF, man, but she just likes the attention, dude.
Hannah Baker is a cocktease, man.
Plus she's, like, batshit crazy, too.
[MARCUS] I should have known people would twist my words.
I feel terrible.
Remember when she bum-rushed the boys' locker room when that list came out? Oh.
Yeah, man.
Now that was crazy.
- Hannah Baker, Hannah "Blue Balls.
" - Hannah "Big Butt.
" [MARCUS] Because that's the thing about gossip.
Once it starts, it's hard to get away from it.
- Jess! Jess, hey.
- Hi.
Good job yesterday.
- Good job? - Yeah, in court.
I heard they've been really tough on people, but you stood your ground and told the truth.
- That's fucking brave, you know? - Right.
Yeah, thanks.
Hey, listen, um, there's this thing this weekend at Bryce's, and I have, like, three different guys I want you to meet.
It's time to get you an upstanding, legit boyfriend, right? I'll see you at practice.
[POP SONG PLAYS] Thanks.
Hey, guys.
What are you doing right now? - Do you wanna ditch with me? - Definitely.
Is everything okay? Yeah, totally.
I just need to get out of here.
- Guys, I cannot skip this class.
- Zach, we need you! - You need my car.
- [JESSICA] Both! Look, if we can't have you, can we maybe Okay, but only if Jess drives.
It's an automatic.
My right foot works.
- Jess drives.
- Thank you, Zachy.
[CAR REVS] This car is so insane.
Shouldn't we steal it and do a road trip across the country? Yes, running from the law, like Thelma and Louise.
Yeah, if Thelma had a bum leg and boy parts.
[GIGGLES] It sounds so sexy when you say it like that.
- I mean, I am pretty sexy.
- You totally are.
I love the movies on a weekday.
No lines.
No waiting.
No people.
Wow, you're in a crazy good mood.
- It's possible I'm just crazy.
- Well, I'm good either way.
Hello! I haven't been to a movie in so long.
- I'm having all the popcorn.
- [SCOFFS] So are you trying to have sex with her now or something? What? No.
Why is that any of your business, anyway? [JESSICA] Hey.
- You okay? - Yeah.
I'm just tired.
No, not just tired.
That night that we came here, - and Hannah confronted me? - Hmm.
I said that she was obsessed with me, and we should stop being friends with her.
- Yeah, but that's not your fault.
- Yeah, but I fucking lied, Jess.
She was just hurt, and then she called me out on it, and I got embarrassed, and I said we should stop hanging out with her.
I'm such an asshole.
We're both assholes.
I got up there in court and tried to help the Bakers, but I just ended up making everything worse.
I just kept remembering all of this stuff.
I don't know, I just wish I could wipe the slate clean and start over.
No, you don't.
It fucking sucks.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean - No, I know.
Will you help me up? And did the school provide any oversight or follow-up for this Dollar Valentine's Day program? No.
Nothing like that.
Incredible, so in other words, Hannah suffered thanks to a misguided, if not outright dangerous program, sponsored by a grossly negligent administration? - Objection.
- Withdrawn.
No more questions.
Hey, what the hell, Tony? You didn't ask me about Sheri.
Yeah, 'cause I knew you would say no.
But she came through, didn't she? We can't just go telling everyone about this.
It's fucking dangerous.
Oh, I'm aware it's dangerous.
That's why I can't be a part of it anymore, Clay.
That's why you can't be part of it? Or is it more than that? Why are you so worried about your probation? You said it was no big deal.
Yeah, that was when I thought this case would settle.
Before I had to testify or help clean a help clean a fucking junkie up so that he could.
Jessica doesn't even want him to.
She just wants the whole thing to go away.
If that's what Jessica wants, it's out of our hands.
Sheri.
Please, please just I'll give you some cash, just please go get me like half a gram, that's all I need.
And then I'll go to court and I can testify, and you'll never have to see me again.
And why do you think I'd know where to buy drugs? Well, apparently you know how to detox someone from drugs.
I had a roommate.
Two roommates in a row who went through this.
[SOBBING] I'm so fucking cold.
Then stop throwing this off and do what I say.
Here, take this.
No.
Look, we don't have time to play games, Justin.
Do you want to help Jessica or not? Huh? Okay, if you do, stop being such a little bitch and get yourself better.
Here.
I've never heard you say "bitch" before.
[SCOFFS] I've never had to babysit your crying ass before.
[COUGHS] You're welcome.
[BURPS, SIGHS] So Hannah became physically violent at the diner, when all you did was try to hold her hand? I mean, please explain to the court how this makes logical sense.
Could you, Marcus? I mean, well, there was more to it than that.
She was only being nice to me at first because she wanted a favor.
She had a crush on another guy, and she asked me to set her up with him.
And you know, I was hurt, and confused, and I tried to take her hand to reconnect with her.
That's when she pushed me.
So after agreeing to go on a date with you, Hannah used it as an opportunity to score a date with another guy? Yes.
Marcus, this is the first we're hearing of this.
Can you please reveal to the jury who Hannah was asking about? He's a friend of mine.
Bryce Walker.
[INDISTINCT MURMURING] [MARCUS] I don't blame Hannah for being interested in someone else.
Like I said, when you're on the outside, you look for a way in.
And Bryce Walker is the king of our school.
Any girl would want him.
- [CLAY] Shit.
Sorry.
- Hey, man, it's cool.
- Sorry.
- Are you okay? I'm fine.
Why? You don't look so good.
What do you know about it? [EXHALES] Just that you don't look so good.
Look out for yourself.
Hey, Kevin.
Got a minute? Sure.
[PANTS] I'm on my way to do the conflict resolution seminar - for freshmen - So good, all those extras you're doing.
It really gives added value at a very, very challenging time.
Well, whatever I can do, Gary.
Okay, along those lines, I understand that you made a little house call.
It's good sometimes to take things out of a formal setting.
- Huh.
- Contact with the parents is important.
Yeah, of course.
Of course.
Uh, and you know [STAMMERS] I very much admire that you take such big swings.
But we're all under a microscope here.
And I think we should discuss what the best strategy is, especially in regards to getting parents involved.
- Hmm.
- You know? So you mean all parents? - Or just the Walkers? - Well, I know.
We'll see if we can make it through the next few weeks, then we'll reconvene after the trial, okay? - I wanna make sure we keep our kids safe.
- Absolutely.
- You know? - Yeah, good work.
[SIGHS] [TYLER] This fucking trial is a fucking joke.
Marcus said Hannah was in love with Bryce, which is a fucking lie.
I tell the truth, I get endless shit.
Marcus does his politician thing and blows back in like the fucking returning king.
What a motherfucker.
What the fuck, dude? Why'd you bring my name up in court? Let's do this later, all right? I'll let you guys talk.
Uh-uh.
No, whatever you got to say, just go ahead and say it.
I mean, we're all brothers here.
Right? [SCOFFS] Right.
Yeah.
Right.
Look, I saw an opportunity to do you a favor, so I took it.
A favor? You think dragging me into this is a favor? No, I planted a seed for you.
See, now if you get called up, they already think Hannah liked you.
And if she came on to you, and you let her down gently, who knows what kind of lies she might've made up? Well, fuck me.
Yeah.
That's some high-level Jedi shit right there, buddy.
[CHUCKLES] - Hey.
- Hey, beautiful.
[BRYCE, CHLOE KISSING] [MOANS] - [CHLOE GIGGLING] - Fucking hypocrites.
I say we do this today.
[BRYCE AND CHLÃE LAUGHING] [ZACH CLEARS THROAT] [INHALES] I'm ready.
- [BELL RINGING] - [DOOR OPENING] - Hi.
- Hey there.
We just wanted to say hi, I guess, and just see how you're doing.
[STAMMERS] Uh, I'm doing okay.
Thank you.
I I mean, some days are better than others, I guess.
But I'm so happy to see you both.
How are you, Alex? I've been thinking about you since I saw you at the deposition.
Yeah, it's just like you said, some days are better than others.
But I'm meeting with the doctor soon.
And hopefully, they'll clear me to testify and everything.
So, just trying to remember anything that might help.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
That means a great deal.
I'm sorry for running away the other day, at court.
No, Jessica, I'm the one who should be sorry.
I just [CHUCKLES] I seem to be saying all the wrong things lately.
It's okay.
It was just a misunderstanding, obviously.
Hi, Liv.
Hi, Andy.
So, anyway, sorry, we just wanted to say hi, Mrs.
Baker.
- [JESSICA] Was nice seeing you.
- Nice to see you.
[ALEX] Bye.
- Hi, Mr.
Baker.
- Hi, Alex.
- [JESSICA] Hey.
- [MR.
BAKER] Jessica.
- [DOOR OPENING] - [BELL RINGING] He's a good kid.
I think they both are.
I saw you on the news the other night.
I thought what you said was beautiful and brave.
Thank you.
Although they still managed to use my own words against us in there.
Uh, yeah, that woman you're working with, maybe she can afford to spend her whole life fighting She's not the one fighting, Andy.
I am.
Can we stop with the contest, please? I'm tired of the game of who suffers more Are you tired? I'm sorry if you're tired.
Okay, I'm sorry if this isn't moving along quickly enough for you so you can get some rest.
You know, not everyone can move on so easily.
Nothing was easy.
- You're a coward and you're afraid.
- Of course I'm afraid! I'm afraid of losing the case, the store, our livelihoods, everything! We already have lost everything! There is nothing left worth having, except justice for our daughter.
And Jackie is the one that's been there every day making sure I get it.
I'll buy you out of the store when we win the case.
- If we win.
- We will win.
Okay? Even if you're not there to see it.
Are you living with her? No, Liv.
I'm not.
- [BELL RINGING] - [DOOR OPENING] - [HANNAH] Hey! - Hi, sweetheart.
- You're out early.
- I took the early shift.
- Can I take the Jeep out later? - On Valentine's Day? - Is this a, uh, date-type thing? - Maybe.
- Yeah? - It's a hangout, really.
- So, can I take the Jeep? - Sure.
We're just about to close up.
Maybe we can all ride home together.
- Great.
I'll warm it up outside.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, would you like to take some Valentine's chocolate on your non-date hangout type thing? Mom, nobody takes chocolate on dates.
It's not 1950.
Uh I thought you said it wasn't a date.
[MRS.
BAKER GIGGLING] [MARCUS] Hannah was a troubled girl, kind of a loner.
I reached out to her, she didn't respond.
And I guess it hurt a little, to be honest.
Hey, Marcus.
Wait up.
You know, I don't have a lot of time to talk right now, Hannah, so just Oh, it's okay.
Uh, this won't take long.
[MARCUS] She used me to get to someone else.
Heard you're disappointed with our date the other night.
Look, I don't know what you thought you heard.
- But - No, I know what I heard.
But, um, then I thought, maybe I should give you another chance, see if we can try things your way after all.
Hey, what the hell are you doing? Isn't this what you wanted, Marcus? [MARCUS PANTING] Isn't this turning you on, to be grabbed like this? Doesn't it make you want to tear off your clothes and do whatever you told your friends you were gonna do to me? Or was it just one big put-on, to pretend you're something you're really not? But you won't tell your friends about this, will you? [MARCUS GROANS] [MARCUS] I'm the student body president.
Part of my job is to reach out, set an example, lift people up.
To look for those kids who feel like "the other.
" Like they're on the outside.
[STUDENTS LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - [INDISTINCT CHATTERING, LAUGHING] - [PHONE CAMERAS CLICKING] - Yeah! - Yeah! - [MAN] Damn! - All right.
All right! That's Okay, you got me.
Very funny.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [MARCUS] And I'll keep reaching out.
There are more kids like Hannah.
And I want them to know people care.
- Oh, shit.
Oh, my - Holy shit.
- That was awesome! - Yeah! [PANTING] What do we, uh what do we do now? Have you shot a gun before? Hey, man, almost forgot.
You know that midterm you got tomorrow? I talked to a buddy who took the class last year.
He said Metcalf always uses the same test.
Shit, man.
- Thank you.
- I got you.
Always.
[MARCUS] And I know Bryce feels the same.
It's up to us to be the good guys.
[GASPS] [CHLOE WHISPERS] Wait.
- Isn't your mom home? - She might be.
Doesn't matter.
I thought I'd go introduce myself.
- Since you haven't.
- Hey, get back here.
What, am I not the kind of girl you can take home to Mom? I hope not.
You know what? I'm offended.
This isn't happening right now.
[CHUCKLES] - Oh, it's happening.
- Get away from me.
[MIMICS CHLOE] "Get away from me.
" You just take whatever you want? You're damn right.
[BRYCE MOANS] [GROANS] ["PILLAR OF TRUTH" PLAYS] [JESSICA] I remember when they said you would never walk again.
Or talk.
Or even be you anymore.
[ALEX] Well, the jury's still out on that one.
I just feel like I have this body, you know? And every day it gets up and puts on clothes and gets me from point A to point B.
But it's like it's not mine anymore or something.
Yeah.
It's like you're living in a stranger's body.
And mind, sometimes.
Yeah.
The pillar of truth Come on.
Turning to dust [ALEX] Yep.
[JESSICA] Sorry.
[BOTH SPEAK INDISTINCTLY] Lord, prepare me For the shadows For the sparrows at my window Lord have mercy On my descendants For they know not what they do For they know not - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, no.
Keep going, keep going.
Who you are And they know not What to do - No, please! - Sorry, I'm - Jess, I'm so sorry.
- No, no.
It's not you, okay? It's just It's not you.
Okay.
Justin's back.
Did you know that? Clay and Tony went out to find him and he's at Clay's house right now.
What the fuck? Clay says he wants to help me.
Can you believe that? - What are you gonna do? - No.
Nothing! Fuck Justin, okay? I never wanna see him again in my life.
Come on.
It's late.
- Sheri, what the hell? - Oh, what's up, Clay? - You were supposed to text me every hour.
- Oh, shit.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I got so into these Alien Killer Robots.
The way they draw these robots is kinda sexy.
- Wait, did you? - Don't worry, I only took out the comics.
- Jesus.
- [SHERI] "Studded and ribbed.
" - Skye's a lucky girl.
- Yeah, she's not, actually.
She's gone.
Fucking ran.
Fuck you, Justin.
You don't know anything about it.
I don't know anything about fucking running? I'm like a fucking ex Oh, shit! - Fuck! - It's the stomach cramps.
Are you good to take over from here? I'm supposed to be home right after school.
I got it.
You can take the stairs.
No one's home.
And make sure you keep him hydrated.
He's gonna have a lot of fevers.
He may talk a lot of shit but don't let it get to you.
He's just in a lot of pain.
Good.
- [DOOR OPENING] - Thank you.
Yeah.
- [DOOR CLOSING] - [GROANS] Did you talk to Jessica? Yeah.
Yeah, she, uh, wanted me to thank you.
She's happy you're here.
- You You didn't tell her all about? - No.
I told her you had the flu.
[LAUGHS] That's good.
So we're gonna do this? - We're gonna take down Bryce? - Yeah.
We are.
[RETCHES] [JUSTIN] Ugh! In 72 to 96 hours.
I thought maybe the sign in my yard was just about my dad's campaign.
- But somebody is targeting me.
- [MR.
PORTER] That's terrible.
And you have no idea who might have done it? No.
You can't think of anyone you may have hurt? Or anyone that may have a reason not to like you? Hey, I'm I'm the victim here.
Marcus, let me, uh, ask you something.
Your father, he's a churchgoing man, right? Yeah.
What do you think he would say if he listened to your tape? [SCOFFS] What would your wife say if she listened to yours? Oh, I already told my wife everything.
And I've taken a long, hard look in the mirror.
Have you? Just find out who did this.
Marcus, I am on borrowed time here at Liberty and I know it.
But as long as I am here, I'm gonna make sure that the kids who actually need my help get it.
And those that need something else? That they get that, too.
Holy shit.
I thought you were talking about BB guns.
What do you use these for? [TYLER] Just, you know, shooting cans and stuff.
But if you don't want to try it, we don't have to.
Oh, hell yeah, I want to try it! You have to teach me how to do it.
Yeah, of course.
Here, just let me.
This one's got a bit of a kick to it.
Okay? So just be ready for it.
Yeah, hold the gun with your dominant hand.
Keep your finger outside, okay? Until you're ready to shoot.
Use your other hand to cradle the gun underneath, it keeps it steady.
This shit's heavy.
[LAUGHS] - [CYRUS] Like that? - [TYLER] Yeah.
- Safety? - Yeah.
Pick a target.
And when you're ready, okay, turn the safety off put your finger on the trigger and squeeze your hands together like this.
Ha! Woo! Woo! He thinks he can just walk in here, giving me advice about Jackie, the trial, after everything he's put me through? - I'm sorry.
- But again, maybe he has a point.
Think I had this fantasy that I was going to tell Hannah's story to the world.
Make them understand.
Certainly aren't getting it in court.
No.
Although, Jessica I think she did her best.
Don't you? Yeah.
Yeah.
I think she did.
She's the girl on the tape, isn't she, Tony? She's the one on tape nine? Is she afraid of Bryce Walker? Is she afraid no one will believe her? Why won't she come forward? Yeah, I have to ask you.
Why do you need her to? She only knows what happened to her, she doesn't know what happened to Hannah.
'Cause Hannah isn't here to speak to what happened to her.
I mean, you're right, it may or may not help our case against the school.
But Tony, it could help build a criminal case against Bryce.
The cops, they already have the tapes.
They won't act on anything unless they have a living victim to tell her story.
And it's gotta come out in court? Dennis says we need a witness who can speak to a pattern of behavior.
It could lead to an arrest, Tony.
Bryce needs to pay for what he did to Hannah, to Jessica, to who knows how many other girls.
I want it to come out.
In court, in a sheriff's office, I don't care where.
And Jessica is the only one who can speak to what happened that night.
And Justin.
Do you know where he is? I can ask around for him again.
I mean, I have a friend who might be able to track him down.
- I'm sorry, okay? - [MR.
STANDALL] Sorry isn't gonna cut it.
You haven't even been back less than a week and you're already skipping school.
[MRS.
STANDALL] Okay, Bill, every 17-year-old kid skips a couple of classes now and then.
[BILL] Well, if he's ever gonna be a normal 17-year-old kid again, he's gotta put in the work, that's all.
I'm sorry I'm not fucking normal! - [MRS.
STANDALL] Language! - I know that's hard for you.
[BILL] That's not what I'm talking about, kid! Alex! [FOOTSTEPS LEAVING] - Honey.
- [SIGHS] You need to ease up on him.
He's trying, okay? Well, he needs to try harder.
'Cause he's got to get better.
He has to get better.
If he doesn't If this is as far as he gets, you've got to stop blaming yourself.
Why? It was my gun.
[EXHALES] Fuck! Fuck! [GRUNTS] [PANTING] [SOBS] Come on, Clay.
[SOBS] [MARCUS] Too many kids still feel powerless.
Jesus.
Marcus Cole turned into a nice surprise today, didn't he? Yeah, I am not sure why Dennis thought he would be good for them, with that kind of story to tell.
Do you think he had that story to tell before today? I think he was quite credible.
Well, hearing Bryce's name sure took the attention away from the school.
Yeah, it's great for us.
These kids, Sonya, teenagers, they, uh, they have secrets.
They know more than they say, and they're very good at telling you the story you want them to.
I've examined teenagers before.
But you haven't lived with them.
- In case you need any advice - A witness is a witness.
But thanks, Lainie.
I appreciate it.
Good night.
[DOOR OPENING, CLOSING] [MARCUS] Hannah made a bad decision.
She acted out of sadness.
Anger.
And I just don't want anyone else to get hurt.
[HANNAH] Are you sure Alex should hear the tapes? Odd question coming from the person who made them.
You were trying to protect him.
If he can remember enough, they might let him testify.
- Testify about what? - About Bryce.
The trial's not about Bryce.
Well, it should be.
That girl's unconscious.
You should show these to someone.
Turn him in.
And say what? "I found this Polaroid in my locker, arrest him?" I got his confession and they did nothing.
- Find the girl.
- We can't see her face.
Find the room.
The couch is the same in both pictures.
Nothing I do is going to make any difference.
Someone has to say something about Bryce that makes them pay attention.
Jessica couldn't do it, they won't let me, maybe Alex can.
Or maybe it will destroy him all over again.
Was Marcus lying? Tell me.
If he was lying, we need someone to tell the truth.
Things like this are gonna keep happening, Clay.
You heard my story the way I wanted it to be told, but there's always another side to every story.
How do I know what's true? You know me, right? I thought I did.
Then do the right thing.
I am.
[MARCUS] But I believe we're turning a corner.
It's getting better.
[CELL PHONE BEEPS] [HANNAH] Hey.
It's Hannah.
Hannah Baker.
Don't adjust your whatever device you're hearing this on.
It's me, live and in stereo.

1 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [RYAN] Nothing that's worth anything comes without pain.
["DAMAGED GOODS" PLAYING] A work of art is only good if it arises from necessity, from need.
And it can be political need or personal need or, ideally, both.
Sometimes I'm thinking That I love you [RYAN] Art should be confrontation.
It should shock and scare you.
And Hannah, she was an artist in need.
And I think that's what happened.
And she freaked people out.
- [CYRUS CLEARS THROAT] - All right.
[TYLER LAUGHS] And how does this not make us more likely to be the targets of abuse and ridicule? Because it's like claiming the word as our own.
Reappropriation.
Like saying we're the assholes, so don't fuck with us.
Okay, yeah, sort of like our superhero outfits, right? Like, "It's a bird, it's a plane, it's the Assholes.
It's us.
" Yeah.
Just maybe don't say that.
Your kiss so sweet Your sweat so sour Sometimes I'm thinking That I love you [RYAN] A soul in need needs a way to express it.
Silence is never the answer.
But when there's so much going on inside you [KEYS JINGLING] society expects us to stay silent.
And it's a dangerous thing when there's so much going on inside you, but no one to share it with.
[DOOR OPENS] Kevin? Honey, you forgot your lunch.
- Thanks.
I'll be right there.
- Okay.
[CHLOE] Good Lord.
These morning practices are killing me.
I'm passing out at exactly 4:30 today.
- Or you could come back to my place.
- [SIGHS] I don't think I'm gonna have the energy For dinner? My parents wanna meet you.
- They do? - Yeah.
- That's so cool.
- [CHUCKLES] - Oh, my God, that's so terrifying.
- No.
It's no big deal.
My dad happens to be in town for a bit.
I'm always talking about you.
I'm so excited.
Amazing.
- See you in third.
- Okay.
Bye.
Babe, I wanted to talk to you about Wait.
I should buy a dress.
- You don't need to buy a dress.
- Or at least go and change.
- I'll need at least an hour, okay? - Yeah, fine.
Hey, uh, how is practice with all the captain stuff and, you know, Jess? It's great.
It's going really well.
Cool.
Awesome.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
[RYAN] Hannah needed to reclaim her power.
Are you gonna ask him about the Polaroid? I don't trust him any more than I did yesterday.
[EXHALES] How can you not trust that little sleeping angel? The fuck are you looking at? Justin, do you think that you can keep your shit together until someone comes over to look after you later? I'm running late.
I gotta get to school.
I'm fine.
I don't need a babysitter.
It's just so fucking cold in here.
- [HANNAH] Chills.
He has a fever.
- It's chills.
You have a fever.
Well, get him another blanket.
- Maybe a shower would help.
- I'm not that bad.
You smell like dead feet.
Just shower, please.
Oh, I'm hungry.
How can you be hungry? You threw everything up.
Maybe that's why I'm hungry.
Take a shower.
Have you seen this? My God, was there anyone in your class this Hannah wasn't involved with? What? What do you mean? Every day, there's another boy in this story.
It's not surprising that she had a reputation.
I will just be glad when this is all over for you tomorrow, and you are as far removed from this mess as possible.
Yep.
[SHOWER RUNNING] [FAINT SPLATTERING] [SIGHS] Hey.
Your mom's starting to think you're avoiding us.
[STAMMERS] Avoiding you? No.
No, no.
I've just got a lot going on, you know? You can't take every meal in your room.
I've just got so much work.
How about taking a break with me tonight? Vertigo is at the Crestmont.
Let's go.
Oh, wow.
I, um Is that the shower? Yeah.
Yeah, that's my, um I just figured I'd grab some food while I let it heat up.
The new tankless heater takes a while to warm up.
- Shouldn't take this long.
- It's not a big deal.
No, sometimes the valve is on the cold side.
It's all good.
Have some coffee.
Yeah, I'll get more.
Yeah.
Movie tonight? Exciting.
So, yeah, thanks.
What the fuck? Yeah, Dad.
Plenty hot.
Water heater's totally working.
- [JUSTIN] Shit.
Sorry.
- Just quiet.
Okay.
[SIGHS] Can you get out now? It has to look like I'm the one in the shower, idiot.
Well, can you pass me some more shampoo? These kids need to be sympathetic, Olivia.
I worry about calling Ryan Shaver.
His deposition was practically smug.
We're putting pieces together.
We have to get Hannah's poem into evidence, and he's the one who printed it.
Morning.
- Hi.
I'm Andy.
- Oh, of course, I remember.
- Will you be joining us today? - No, he won't.
Well, I'll give you two a minute.
I wanna be here with you.
I need to be here.
I'm sorry I haven't been.
The things they've been saying in there, things that you'll hear, you have no idea.
I'll learn.
[JUSTIN] I don't know.
It's definitely not the pool house.
[CLAY] So, where is it, then? I could ask one of the guys and maybe figure out No.
You stay here until you're clean.
For Jessica.
I could just show this around.
It's No, I got it.
Thanks.
[TONY] Fuck me.
Fuck.
Wait He's my babysitter? What happened to Sheri? Sheri couldn't skip twice in a row.
She's taking the evening shift.
I thought he wanted nothing to do with me.
No, I don't.
So keep your mouth shut and don't piss me off.
Don't piss me off.
And if you puke on this leather, I'm gonna have to kick your ass.
Great.
So, WebMD detox info and contingency plans are on the desk.
Don't let anyone see you.
And I gotta go.
Um, have fun.
Don't kill each other.
Thanks.
[CLAY] Bye.
[RYAN] But, as is almost always the case in high school, we mock what we don't understand.
That's what kids at Liberty did to Hannah.
[DENNIS] What about faculty? I mean, didn't they express concern over the poem's suicidal contents? The poem was read aloud in Mrs.
Cusick's class.
That's about it.
So no one addressed the anonymous author's obvious cry for help or asked you who wrote it? Nope.
No one took it seriously.
But then again, they rarely do.
["MANIAC" PLAYING] We hit the big time Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm such a maniac You're such a maniac We're fuckin' maniacs We're fuckin' maniacs Ooh [MR.
PORTER] Mr.
Down? The city of night Is the city of fools My office, now.
I think you know why you're here.
Yeah, I'm aware.
You wanna tell me about these? Wait, that's what this is about? You took the pictures.
Yeah, last year.
How'd they end up saying, "drunk slut"? Mr.
Porter, I didn't do that.
I went into the photography classroom, and the printer history in the lab said that you were signed in.
Someone must've used it while I was developing in the darkroom then.
Okay.
[SCOFFS] So do we know who might be doing this to Jessica, then? Same person who smashed my camera.
Did anyone ever find them? But Jessica and I get messed with? And the people that deserve to get messed with never do.
I think that can change.
I'll believe it when I see it.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Isn't this, like, your special resources period? Yeah, I hate that shit.
I just I gotta listen to these again.
Alex, uh last time, you listened, I think, multiple times.
Yeah, I know.
I just I keep listening to mine over and over because it doesn't make sense.
It's like I'm missing something.
Do you Do you wanna talk about it? - Aren't we talking about it? - I guess so.
[CLAY] Hey, what is that guy doing? [ALEX] Uh, chalking the field.
What is that machine? [ALEX] I don't know.
Like I guess it's a chalk machine? I gotta go.
I don't know if it's called a chalk machine.
No, I just - Look, don't listen too hard, okay? - Yeah.
[HANNAH] It seems like nothing until the hurricane hits.
Is that why you did it, Alex? [RYAN] I can't pretend to know what goes on in someone else's head.
It's poetry.
Most of the poets in our group write about dark and messed-up things.
So you had no idea that Hannah was crying out for help in her work, or so the prosecution would have us believe, but you expect the school to draw that conclusion? [RYAN] It's their job, isn't it? I mean, I'm sorry, but I'm not a licensed therapist, or a teacher.
Ryan, isn't it true that you worked with Hannah on many of her other poems? Some, yes.
And do you recognize these? Yes, they're other poems from Hannah's journals.
Defense Exhibit F, Your Honor.
Uh, Ryan, did you work with Hannah on this poem? Yes, I did.
Would you read this poem for the court, please? "Oh, fruit forbidden, so sour, so sweet" [HANNAH] "I have been banished from the garden, and I don't think I miss it.
And yet I want another bite.
" [POP MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY OVER SPEAKERS] I like how you subverted the ode.
That's good.
Some obvious metaphors there, but there's a universality to it.
- I'm just - [CELL PHONE PINGS] Sorry, uh, keep going.
I was going to say, I'm just wondering if you shouldn't delve a little deeper.
You had another you wanted to read? - Uh - [PHONE PINGS] - Yeah.
- Okay.
Look, I know it seems silly, but the no-phone rule is for a very good Justin Foley? Shut up.
Are? Hang on.
Holy shit.
- He's your forbidden fruit? - No, he's not.
- We just text sometimes.
- Oh, you text? And talk on the phone a little.
- Since when? - I don't know.
He texted me that day saying he was sorry, and then, again, the next day.
Eventually, I stopped ignoring him.
And it felt good to know that things didn't end up the way - that people think they did.
- What? - You just told me to delve deeper.
- Not into him.
- You said yourself he ruined you.
- I know.
- I know, I just - Okay.
I get it.
He makes all our panties drop.
Wait, you think Justin's hot? Of course I do.
I'm not blind, or, like, chemically castrated.
You said, and I'm quoting, that he was "the exemplar of athleticus douchebaggerus.
" Which only makes him hotter.
- I know, right? How is that even fair? - All right, enough.
You put your hand on the hot stove.
Owie! You've learned your lesson.
- Yes? - Yes.
[CHUCKLES] You are going to delete him from your phone - Ugh.
- And cleanse him from your heart.
Well, we should probably skip my next three poems.
- [CHUCKLING] - Why? [SIGHS] "It was the smile that did it first.
The way it seemed so easy for you to be so happy.
That smile I wish I'd never seen.
" - Stop it.
- [CHUCKLES] And do you know who this poem is about, Ryan? - Objection.
Hearsay.
- Declarant unavailable, Your Honor.
- [JUDGE] I'll allow it.
- And who is this poem about, Ryan? I don't know.
Hmm.
Ryan, why don't you read another poem for us? [TYLER] Fucking Ryan Shaver.
Every single kid who's gone to court has completely skated.
No one has admitted what they did.
It's just me.
I'm the only one.
- Yeah, that Ryan's a fucking tool.
- Worst kind of gay.
I mean, I didn't mean that because he's gay.
Oh, I did.
He's fucking shallow and pretentious, and he fucking dresses gay every day.
[EXHALES] Classic homo.
Chad's also gay, FYI.
Hence, he can say shit the rest of us can't.
And if you ever want to fuck with him, there's an app for that.
I raised you three rectangular ones.
If I win, we get to go outside.
- No.
- Come on, just for a walk.
No.
I'm sorry.
You heard the bossman.
Besides, you got people looking for you on both sides of the law.
Since when is Tony Padilla afraid of shit like that? Holy shit.
You are scared.
Why? My brothers and I, we beat this guy up.
He ended up pressing charges a few weeks later.
That was my second strike, now I'm on probation.
If I get seen with you, we get busted, that means number three, that means I do time.
Shit.
[JUSTIN SNIFFING] What the fuck happened to you? - You don't gotta tell me.
- No, no, no.
It's It's cool.
It's I just basically blew through most of my money the first few weeks I was out, living in, like, motels and shit.
Yeah, oxy was like taking the edge off, but all these pills are so pricey, and heroin's cheap.
So you know, here I am.
Shitting myself in Clay Jensen's bathroom.
Put your fucking shoes on.
So your parents weren't pissed about yesterday? No.
They were disappointed.
Oh, disappointed.
I hate that shit.
Plus, they want me to go to group therapy, talk to someone.
- You can always talk to me.
- That's what I said.
Yeah, I won't, um, try to kiss you every time or anything.
[SCOFFS] Yeah.
About that, I, uh [STAMMERS] No, I mean, we don't have to We don't have to be about that, you know, ever again, so Okay.
Thanks.
I listened to the tapes.
Clay finally gave them to me.
Jesus.
Are you - Are you okay? - Yeah.
Are you? You never told me the whole story about Bryce.
If I wanted to talk about that, I'd go to stupid group therapy.
Okay.
Yeah, I get it.
I don't even know the whole story myself.
- I don't remember all of it.
- Yeah, me neither.
[CLAY] Here we go.
I think I saw one of those chalk machine things in here somewhere.
Which would mean? The pictures were taken at school.
And? It would be huge for your case.
And? And holy shit, there it is.
We gotta find that room.
[RYAN] "Do I put that target on my back again and again? Or do I face a lifetime of wanting the thing I should not have?" [SONYA] You've read three poems now, so I'll ask you again, who were these poems about? [DENNIS] Objection.
Asked and answered.
- [SONYA] Your Honor? - [JUDGE] I'll allow it.
Who's the poem about, Ryan? Justin Foley.
So, after Justin Foley, in her own words, "ruined her and destroyed her reputation," she maintained contact with him? Yes.
- And kept writing poetry about him? - Yes.
[SONYA] Nearly a half-dozen poems.
Any further mention of depression or cries for help? No.
And to your knowledge, did she maintain personal contact with Justin Foley? I I don't know.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY OVER SPEAKERS] Uh hey.
[CHUCKLES] [STAMMERS] You texted me you were here.
Never thinking you would, like, come visit.
Yeah, well - Did you just feel like a latte? - [CHUCKLES] Actually, do you think they have Gatorade here? I'm guessing no.
Yeah, I've actually never been in here.
Well, neither have any of your friends, so it's safe.
That's not I just We haven't really talked in a while, so I I thought maybe I wanted to see you, that's all.
Well, you see me at school.
Yeah, but you know how that is.
I don't, really.
How is it? Look, I don't fucking like it, either.
But once you get tagged at Liberty, that's what you've got.
Your tag seems a little easier to live with than mine.
Look, I said I was sorry.
I've been saying it for months.
- Texting it, mostly.
- Well - I am.
- [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Sorry I'm late.
- Why, hello, Justin.
- Uh, hey, hey.
Wha What's up? [JUSTIN] Yeah, we were just finishing up some homework stuff, so - Yeah, I'll see you at school.
- Sure.
Talk to you at school.
Look, he just showed up.
- Hmm.
- I didn't ask him to.
I know.
- Okay, I know.
Leave me alone.
- Cleanse him, Hannah, cleanse.
Cleanse.
I mean, she wrote about longing, about love and the lack of love.
Why didn't you publish any of those poems? Because they weren't any good.
[SONYA] Ryan, be honest.
You published the poem you did not because it was her truth, but because you thought it would shock the most, didn't you? No.
She wasn't happy.
She was extremely upset and hurting.
She wrote about Justin and And other boys because she was lonely.
It's not about them, it's about what they represented.
What they did to her and what you're doing right No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Ryan.
Redirect, Your Honor? Ryan, why do you think Hannah continued texting with Justin? Justin Foley was a bad decision.
And we all make bad decisions.
Especially when we're desperately alone.
- Yeah, I think we should head back now.
- No.
It's so nice out.
Some fresh air, some vitamin D.
- Yeah.
- Some some - Oh, shit.
- Oh, come on.
[RETCHES] Shit.
- Sorry.
- Jesus Christ, man.
Don't fucking talk to people.
I was just apologizing to the purple tracksuit lady.
It's Ugh.
I don't get this whole secret agent routine.
Oh, really, you don't get that there are some people who might not be happy to have you back? Jessica wants me back.
That's all that fucking matters.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Right? That's what she said, right? - I didn't talk to her, Clay did.
He said she wants me here.
[ROCK MUSIC BLARING OVER SPEAKERS] [TONY] I don't think I don't think it's that simple.
- I think she - What? What is it? Does that car look familiar? - [JUSTIN] Whose is it? - I don't know.
Obviously, they go to our school.
So you got your wish.
Everybody's gonna know you're back.
- [CAR HONKING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] - I'm glad you came.
- [ANDY] Me, too.
- That was a lot to take.
- Oh, today was a good day.
It can get much worse, believe me.
I believe you.
See you tomorrow.
It's nice seeing you two together.
- Nice for the jury, too, right? - That's not what I'm thinking.
- Well, I am.
- Okay, I understand.
I'm worried about you, though.
It's easy to fall into old patterns, to rely on someone who has proven unreliable.
Don't worry.
I've moved on.
[RYAN] A lot of us keep holding on even when we should let go.
- Shit.
- [HANNAH] Floors don't match.
[SIGHS] No couch.
Damn it.
There has to be some athletics room somewhere.
Maybe Justin could help.
You would say that.
What does that mean? - How are you so quick to forgive him? - I didn't say I forgave him.
Why do girls even like guys like Justin? I mean, why did you? He's always been an asshole.
His best friend is a rapist.
I didn't know that then.
You were warned.
- Kat warned you.
- Oh, so it's my fault? - I'm not saying that.
- What are you saying, then? I just I don't understand why people love people who aren't good for them.
I don't know what to tell you.
We don't choose who we fall for.
Yeah.
Tell me about it.
You sure it was Justin? [SCOFFS] That's what I heard.
Why would he be with Tony? Think he came back to testify? - Fuck if I know, or care.
- [COACH] All right, listen up.
State guy's coming down tomorrow to do the screens.
So if that is a concern for you, see me in my office.
Hey.
You all set for tomorrow? For court? You want me to come with you? That's all right, Coach.
But thanks.
[MONTGOMERY] Think that's why he came back? [BRYCE] I don't know.
Drop it.
[MONTGOMERY SCOFFS] Go.
Everything's fine.
Yeah, you keep saying that.
You tell me you've got shit taken care of, but I don't see it.
- And why the fuck do you care, exactly? - [SCOFFS] You, man.
Us.
State.
All taken care of.
Go.
Get your synthetic pee.
Zachy, you coming? No, I'm good, brother.
Don't need it.
Not gonna tell on us, are you? Why, you think I'm a rat? No, of course not.
I just wish I had your genes, man.
- You did all right.
- [LAUGHS] You flatter me.
[ZACH] Got your back, brother.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.
Thanks, ladies.
I'm probably overthinking it, but not every girl gets to meet the parents, right? - True.
Later, girl.
- Bye.
Hey, Jess.
- Great work today.
- Thanks.
Sorry we had to end early.
I have to go home and change for dinner with Bryce's parents.
- I have no idea what I'm gonna wear.
- [CHUCKLES] Yeah.
I'm sure you could wear anything, ChlÃe, and they'll still love you.
Hey, Jess.
We'll find you a man, okay? You just have to let me help you.
I mean it.
I kinda pride myself on my matchmaking Look, ChlÃe, I don't want a fucking boyfriend.
Okay? The last thing I need in my life right now is some fucking guy.
And you, the fact that you keep, like, offering that means you're just as fucking clueless as I thought.
[DOORBELL RINGS] [RYAN] I was trying to be Hannah's friend.
I needed a friend as much as she did.
Um.
Hi.
Hi.
I, um I was friends with Hannah, and I let her down, and I'm sorry.
I just wanted to come by and say what they're doing to her is bullshit.
Thank you.
Can I? Can I ask you some questions about Hannah's journals? Oh, um Yes, of course.
[OLIVIA] She mentions "the clubhouse" in three different poems.
"Something changed after the clubhouse.
I imagined myself for a moment one of the elite, but I never should have gone to the clubhouse.
" "in his lucky letter jacket.
" - That's gotta be Justin, right? - It could be.
I don't know.
I don't remember anything about a clubhouse.
Damn it.
Okay.
What about "the intruder"? He comes up several times, too.
There's a whole poem about him.
"Sometimes the intruder doesn't need to break a window.
Sometimes they already have the key.
" Do you know this one? No.
I think it's about the bullying at the school.
The house is on fire, her lungs are filling up with smoke, and the intruder, it's this other Hannah that everyone thought they knew.
Oh, no, that makes sense.
[HANNAH GROANS] It's fucking useless, Ryan.
We write and write about shit, and nothing ever changes.
I'm done.
Hannah, you have a gift.
Not gonna let you throw that away.
A gift? - You say that so easily like you know.
- I do.
Yeah, well, I wish I did.
I wish I didn't need people to tell me I'm good, or that they like me, but I do.
That That's great stuff.
That's what you should write about.
No.
Enough writing about my emotions.
Can we just eat them? [CHUCKLES] Yeah, we can totally eat them.
[EXHALES] Vanilla or mint chocolate chip? Please.
Vanilla is not a flavor.
It's an admission of defeat.
- ["TINSELTOWN SWIMMING IN BLOOD" PLAYING] - [CHUCKLES] I was blind Off in the corner doing poet's work [RYAN] Hannah was so talented, but she didn't know it.
It was just a dream [RYAN] She wrote out of love, out of need.
I couldn't see [RYAN] And I wanted to show her that the rush of people loving your work is just as good as love.
Doing poet's work That's all right for now - [RYAN] So I stole her poem.
- It was just a dream Of your blue eyes Tinseltown dripping in blood [RYAN] It was just one poem.
[SONG ECHOES, FADING] But I was wrong.
I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
Sometimes I fantasize that all the answers are in these torn-out pages.
Oh, I I don't think so, I [CHUCKLES] I imagine those are just false starts or things she was ashamed to even admit to herself.
Why did she keep in contact with Justin? Loneliness.
It can be intense at our age.
It's not just at your age.
[RYAN] What she needed most was love.
Human connection.
[CHIMES] You didn't quit cheerleading because Justin's back? I know, news travels fast in these halls.
Don't care.
- You don't care that he's back? - No.
Know where he's staying? Justin needs help, too.
He should be enrolled in school.
The only address I have of him is his dad in Sacramento.
Oh, well.
Jess, I'll be honest.
I know what it's like to try to be strong and keep your problems all to you.
But it does not work.
You don't have to talk to me.
But talk to someone.
If I don't have to talk to you, can I go? Justin's never met his dad.
His mom lives with some drug dealer named Seth.
- Do you think she likes her? - Your mother? - Yeah.
- Uh, sure.
ChlÃe's a great girl.
Very pretty.
Yeah, she's got a brain, too.
Her grades are better than mine.
[CHUCKLES] And she's loyal? Yeah.
That's important.
- You did good.
- Thanks, Dad.
Here we go.
Wow.
You seem quite happy, the two of you.
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
He's so sweet to me, like, all the time.
- Sweet? - Yeah.
- That's good to hear.
- [CHUCKLES] Oh.
Cheerleading.
Full-contact sport.
I see.
[SOFT LAUGHTER] How do you know about Justin? Because Jessica told me when we ditched with your car yesterday.
Said that Clay went and found him.
- Clay? - Yeah.
Okay, do you know anything about where he's living or why he's back? No, Zach, and I really don't fucking care.
Why is everything always about fucking Justin? - Whoa.
Relax, dude.
It's not.
- [SIGHS] - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah.
Jessica and I kissed yesterday.
Seriously? Dude, that's that's great.
Is that great? Yeah, well, but then she freaked out on me.
And now it's just It's totally weird.
I Yeah, that makes sense that she would freak out.
Yeah.
But I just I still think it has something to do with Justin.
And you know what's the most fucked up? When we kissed, I couldn't even feel anything.
- You mean, like, emotionally, or? - No, like, down there.
I was just numb.
I haven't really felt anything, like, post-coma.
- Have you tried porn? - Yeah, of course I've tried porn.
But I thought with a real person, maybe it would, you know.
Yeah.
Well, dude, honestly, it'll happen.
You just gotta find the right girl.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
All right, well, let me know when you find yours.
Maybe she's got a friend who's into scrawny and broken.
Well, not broken forever.
Let's go.
Come on.
[SIGHS] [LAINIE] I'm sorry, Sheri.
He went to the movies with his dad.
- He must have forgotten to text you.
- Yeah, he must have.
I'm happy that you two are friends again.
I know you've been through a great deal.
Yeah, we have.
I think Clay's still working on trying to forgive me.
- Well, if he asked you to come study - Yeah.
Actually, why don't you stay? Wait for him.
Sure.
Can I ask you a question for a case that I'm working on? Let's say a boy and a girl, uh, have been texting a lot, and then all of a sudden, it stops, what would that mean? Well, they were probably dating, right? Then they broke up.
What if they never dated? Oh.
That's probably just a hookup.
[RYAN] Hannah was desperate for human connection, and I betrayed her.
["WILL YOU BE BY ME" PLAYING] I guess I left her even more lonely than she was before.
And I guess I know how she feels.
When the diction starts [CHUCKLES] And it breaks my heart Will you be by me If my heart would fail How'd it go today? Um.
Not great, actually.
You're fine.
I didn't say anything, if you're worried.
I wasn't.
I just wanted to know how you were doing.
Are you here alone? - You wanna join us? - "Us"? Caleb, Ryan.
Ryan, Caleb.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice handshake, wow.
[CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Sure you don't wanna join us? Yeah, actually, no, I was just leaving.
I got stood up.
Apparently, my date joined the app today.
He's a noob, so you know.
Just Um Forget him.
Stay.
Plus I want some dirt on Mr.
Perfect here.
- Oh, he knows about our past, that's - Barely any of it.
[TONY] You're not interested in high school bullshit.
[CALEB] If it's about you, I am.
Come on, Ryan.
Seriously.
Stay.
[RYAN] What Hannah needed was a friend, and I wasn't that.
[WOMAN] For the longest time, nothing was the same.
How long I slept, what I ate, what I wore.
I mean, my clothes didn't feel like me anymore.
Bright colors made me feel like a fraud and my black clothes didn't seem dark enough, and Just nothing seemed to fit.
Just literally everything felt like a lie.
And nothing I did seemed to help.
No drink, no drug.
Well, I didn't actually try every drug, but let me tell you, weed just had me crying and all in my feelings.
You know, but the one thing that did seem to help was all of you.
And I'm thankful today that just coming here and talking to you has been the thing that's brought me back to who I am.
You know, a loud, pushy, pain in the ass.
[LAUGHTER] But you know you love me, and I love you.
Thank you.
Took you long enough.
How did you know? About me.
Um, I didn't.
I just figured in case those rumors were bullshit, which they obviously were, that I'd be a friendly face.
Friendly and slightly stalkerish? [CHUCKLES] I don't stalk.
I lurk.
- Oh, okay.
- And it worked, didn't it? Yeah.
[LAUGHS] - [METAL MUSIC BLARING] - Wild and free - Wild and free - [MRS.
DOWN] Ty? - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Wild and free - Honey? - [KNOCKING CONTINUES] Wild and free - Ty.
- In the heat of the summer - Better call out a plumber - Ty.
Turn it down.
- What? - Turn the music down.
[MUSIC FADES] Hey, sorry, what? That's, um some music.
- It's punk.
- Oh.
They sound angry.
- They are.
- Oh.
Okay.
Uh What are they so angry about? Everything.
- I see.
- Yeah.
Mr.
Barbour called today.
From up the street.
He said he saw you and your friend, Cyrus, shooting guns on his property.
What? Shooting guns? That wasn't me.
I don't know, I - That old guy's crazy, I guess.
- No.
He said it was you.
That's why he called me and not the police.
Oh, wait, does he mean does he mean Cyrus' BB gun? - Is that what he's talking about? - A BB gun? It's like this old thing Cyrus has.
It's like a toy.
You know, it's not real.
- Maybe that's what he saw.
- Oh.
Okay.
Hmm.
Still, you know how I feel about guns of any kind.
Yeah.
No, I do, I do.
And I even I told Cyrus that.
Which is why we went to Mr.
Barbour's field to be extra careful.
And did Cyrus give you that music? And that shirt? We made the shirts ourselves, you know.
They're quite bold.
I hope you save them for the appropriate audience, and not school.
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Well - Don't stay up too late.
- I won't.
- G'night.
Love you.
- Good night.
[SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, there.
Hi.
[WOMAN] I think there's something wrong with your camera.
Oh, yeah, it's broken, so What's your name, cutie? Um My name is Zach.
Well, hi, Zach.
If I can't see you, how will I know how big and hard you are? Um Well, I could describe myself.
Yeah, I'm 6'3".
I'm jacked 'cause I work out a lot.
Sounds like a hot bod.
You like this? - Yeah, I do like that.
- [WOMAN] Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that's good.
- Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Mmm.
Oh, God.
[PANTING] Fuck! God damn it.
What's wrong? You don't like? No.
I mean, yes, I do, I [SIGHS] No, I do like it.
It's not you, it's me.
I just I don't work.
And I'm not I'm not 6'3", I'm not jacked, I'm I'm really skinny and funny-looking, and my dick's broken.
Okay.
Um Honey, how old are you? - Twenty-five.
- Uh-huh.
Look, it's 18 or older.
Sorry, kiddo.
[SIGHS] I'm sorry.
I didn't get your text message.
The procedure is if you see the car, you go through the window.
Your whole family has the same car.
- I thought it was you.
- Mine is smaller.
Okay, anyways, I made an excuse to go to your room and use your bathroom, so that Tony could leave, and Justin's been asleep ever since.
Well, at least he didn't get discovered.
Yeah, um, about that [DOOR OPENS] When were you gonna tell me someone saw you? When were you gonna tell me about Jess? I talked to Tony.
- She doesn't want me here, does she? - It's complicated.
- You lied to me.
- No, I It's the truth.
Jessica just doesn't realize it yet.
- [SCOFFS] - She'll change her mind.
You have to get sober, and she'll see.
Fuck that.
I'm wasting my time.
She kept your postcard.
It's how we found you.
She kept it, Justin.
"Nancy, I'll always love you.
Sid.
" Why would she keep that? I really did love her.
[SOFT POP SONG PLAYING] So, stay.
[RYAN] Do you wanna know why Hannah wrote these poems? She was reaching out.
She was desperate to be heard, to connect.
And people took that lifeline and they twisted it.
Hey, kiddo.
- You okay? - Yeah.
Uh, I was I was thinking maybe I'd try to sleep in here tonight.
Really? - That's wonderful.
- Yeah, well, it's fine.
Do you want me to tuck you in, or is that silly? Silly.
[JESSICA CHUCKLES] [RYAN] They took her own story away from her.
[DOORBELL RINGS] And she fought to get it back.
- Who are you? - Kevin Porter.
Guidance counselor at Liberty High.
I'm looking for your son.
Look, what can I tell you? He ran away.
You don't wanna know how he's doing, or is he alive, or? He can take care of himself, okay? Always has.
- Ma'am, he's 17 years old.
- [CAR DOOR SLAMS] [SETH] Who the fuck are you? I'm Justin's guidance counselor, Kevin Porter.
And you are? I'm the one that punk stole a thousand dollars from.
So you gonna get me my money back? Well, I'm not really here for that.
Then I suggest you get the fuck off my property.
Listen.
Justin, he needs a home.
Well, he had a home, and he fucked it up.
Case closed.
- Goodbye.
- Okay, I wish you would back off.
[CHUCKLES] - Or what? - Don't do that, man.
You gonna give me detention, huh? [GRUNTS] Ah! Come on! [GRUNTS] [RYAN] But in the end, the story they told was so loud that it's all that she could hear and she started to believe it and forgot who she was.
Fuck.
[RYAN] It's easy to let that happen, to lose yourself.
To believe that no one could ever know you, or love you.
- [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] - [SIRENS WAILING] [RYAN] And that you're the only person that knows what you're going through.
And you convince yourself it's going to get better.
And then, it doesn't.

1 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [HANNAH] Zach, I wrote you a letter.
I poured my heart out, opening up about personal things I hadn't had the courage to admit to anyone.
How hard life was getting.
How lonely I felt.
[ZACH] I keep to myself mostly.
I don't always tell people things.
I'm not good with [MRS.
DEMPSEY] Zach? like, drama.
You look good.
Very sharp.
You ready for this? Yeah, I'm all ready.
Yeah.
I learned pretty early on not to rock the boat.
- You'll do great.
- To stay in my lane.
You're a good boy.
The best son a mother could have.
Don't worry, Mom.
It'll be fine.
[SHERI] Don't worry about it.
Okay? He'll be back.
He's sick as hell.
He can't go to the city.
He's got no money, no car.
- Clay, I'm on your side, okay? - [SIGHS] We'll figure this out.
Thank you.
- Can Can I trust you? - Always.
Do you have any idea where at school these might have been taken? No, I I don't recognize it.
- Wait, is that? - Bryce.
Wow.
Yup.
[ZACH] I try not to be a bully.
[WOMAN] Mr.
Baker! - [ZACH] I try not to be a victim.
- What do you expect from today? We firmly believe that our daughter deserved better and that the school the school could have done more.
We don't let ourselves forget that.
That's how we keep ourselves going.
- We're in this together.
- [WOMAN] Mr.
Baker, one more question.
We're in this together.
- [MAN 1] Thank you, sir.
- [MAN 2] Thank you.
Olivia, everything okay? Just hope that dumb kid tells the truth in there today.
Liv, this time, we have actual proof that Hannah told the school that she was hurting.
She wrote that note in class.
They did nothing.
We're right on this one.
- It's a win.
- [JACKIE] I agree.
And it is so good to see you both here.
Though, if I may say, now that we're playing you're a united front, it is helpful to hold hands for the press.
We're not playing at anything.
[ZACH] It's a tough line to walk.
[DENNIS] So this bullying that you just mentioned, do you feel pressure to join in when you see it happening? - [ZACH] Yes, sir.
- What type of bullying do you see? Well, sometimes it's obvious and sometimes it's not.
Sometimes a kid gets roughed up.
A lot of the times, though, it's just stuff that people say.
Especially athletes.
[DENNIS] So, what type of stuff do you say? We brag about things that we do with girls, like uh sexually.
Even when they're not true.
And sometimes that can get around.
[DENNIS] And who's saying these things? Lots of kids.
[ZACH] It's a tough school.
Three weeks before you went to the hospital, you received the tapes.
Do you remember how? At school? No, they were mailed to you.
On tape five, Hannah talks about running into you and Jessica at the winter formal.
Remember what she said about you two? That we looked good together? No.
You weren't at the dance with Jessica.
You just talked to her there.
Well [STUTTERS] - Did you Have you been studying? - Yes, I've been fucking studying.
Clay, I've listened to the tapes, like, four times.
I don't even know if the doctor's gonna ask me any of this today.
I went online.
Some doctors tested Marines that had TBI with dates and memory questions to see if they could continue serving.
I'm not a fucking Marine, Clay.
I shot myself in the head.
Mr.
Porter is out this morning.
I'm Ms.
Paul, and we're going to be watching a very interesting film.
[GASPS] Human Centipede? [LAUGHTER] Well, no.
It's not a nature film.
[CHUCKLES] It's, uh It's about life after high school, and how it gets better.
That's great, but what the hell are we supposed to do until then? [MS.
PAUL CHUCKLES] I superglued the DVD player shut.
So now we wait to see how long it takes her to figure it out.
Dude, come on, celebrate me.
My neighbor saw us shooting.
- So my dad's calling your dad.
- Shit.
But now he wants to take us shooting.
So, wait, we're getting in trouble for shooting guns, so they're taking us to go shoot guns? Essentially, yeah.
[CHORTLES] Do adults think these things through? - I know, but - No, dude, I'm there.
- Fuck, yeah.
- Yeah, cool.
All right.
[CHUCKLES] Who is good with electronics? [SIGHS] - This silent treatment gonna last all day? - What do you want me to say, Kev? I was glad to bail you out of jail and wait two hours at the impound? You said that I should use the time that I have left to do the most good.
Take care of those kids.
And how is assaulting a drug dealer taking care of those kids? He all but put a price tag on Justin Foley's head.
And what happened to the back window, hmm? [MR.
PORTER] It It must have happened during the fight.
- I mean, we'll we'll get it fixed.
- It's not about the car.
It [SIGHS] Look, I'm proud of you, Kev.
Fighting for these kids, doing whatever you can, I get it.
But, baby, there's glass in Mason's car seat.
I want you to do you.
But what if someone from the school finds out what happened and you get fired? They won't, all right? - And what if you get hurt next time? - There won't be a next time.
I promise.
Okay? [RYAN] So I'm obsessed with this new life you're leading.
But can I ask you about your old cheerleading days? Sure.
You ever heard of a place called The Clubhouse? It's a place where jocks hung out maybe.
No, it doesn't sound familiar.
Anything else you know about it? Apparently, Hannah went there with an athlete, possibly Justin, - long after they broke up.
- Are you serious, Ryan? You're really trying to dig up dirt on Hannah? No, I wasn't.
I'm interested.
Yeah, well, your interest tends to end up in your zine.
I would never.
I I was just You're right.
I'll drop it.
[ZACH] It is especially tough on girls.
It was for Hannah.
To your knowledge, neither Mrs.
Bradley nor any Liberty faculty took any action once this anonymous note was read aloud? Not to my knowledge, no.
So a note expressing interest in suicide was read aloud in class, and faculty members ignored it? - [SONYA] Objection.
Asked and answered.
- [JUDGE] Sustained.
[DENNIS] No further questions, Your Honor.
Hey, Kevin.
How you doing, buddy? How's that new class going? - It's all good, thanks.
- Good.
Glad to hear it.
Just helps keep your head down and, you know, focus on work when things get a little messed up, you know.
Like last night.
I'm sorry? I got a buddy I went to high school with, and, uh, he's one of the lieutenants at the station there.
- He called me when they brought you in.
- It was a misunderstanding.
[CHUCKLES] You know, look, we've all been there, you know? And apparently, they got that dealer guy there, like, once a week.
But, look, I vouched for you, and he said that they'd all make it go away.
- I see.
- I'm just gonna keep this between us.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] So, yeah, I spent the entire night in my own bed, and my dad only stayed for half of it.
Yeah, I mean, that is everything.
[JESSICA] Too easy to get sucked back in to old shit.
I can handle it now.
Hey, what's up? Uh Do you know Michael? - Hi.
- Hey.
Michael.
- [CLAY] So what did your doctor say, Alex? - I'm sorry, I tried.
- But they're not gonna let me testify.
- [CLAY] Shit.
Did the doctor say why? Justin.
Hey, Jess.
I missed you.
Can we go somewhere else to talk, alone? No.
I came back for you.
It's the only reason why I'm here.
If you want me to stay, I promise you I'm here for good.
Look, if you want me to go, I'll go.
Forever, this time.
- You said that before.
- I I tried to go away.
I tried to forget about you.
I I tried so fucking hard.
But I can't stop thinking about you.
Yeah, I think about you, too.
And I wish you were dead.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you more.
You.
- Justin! - [STUDENTS MURMUR] - [CLAY] Justin.
- [TONY] Justin, wake up.
- Justin.
Justin.
- Wake up.
Wake up.
Justin.
[TONY] Fuck.
- Yeah, we gotta get him back to my house.
- No, I can't do this anymore.
- Okay? I'm out.
- What do you mean you're out? - There is no "we," okay? - What the fuck is up with you? - We gotta get him out of here.
- Yeah.
Come on, Justin.
Use your legs.
Use your legs.
Did you know he was back? No, no, we really didn't know.
What does it matter to you? Why do you fucking care if Justin's back? Because, clearly, you do.
I don't fucking care.
You don't know how I feel.
Yeah, you're right.
I don't.
Zach, isn't it true that Hannah also reached out to you to talk about her feelings? - Um, yes.
- And did she write a note to you? A note that was not anonymous? Yes.
Yeah, she wrote me a letter explaining how sad she felt about everything.
How she felt really alone a lot of the time.
So you told no one at Liberty High that Hannah wrote you a note telling you how alone she felt? I didn't know how to.
But isn't it true that you did reach out to her off campus? Um The summer after sophomore year.
The summer after the note.
Did you have contact with her? - Yes.
- And isn't it true that you saw her more than once that summer? [ZACH] Um, yeah, last summer was slow.
Most people were out of town.
- You take them, okay? - Sure thing.
Can I help you? Hey.
Yeah, can I get a box of Mike and Ikes, a box of Hot Tamales and a Diet Coke, please? No, you cannot have fucking Mike and Ikes and Hot Tamales because you're not a fucking child.
- Actually, his mommy says he is.
- Okay.
Fuck off, you guys.
Don't you get tired of the mama's boy jokes? [MONTGOMERY] Uh, no.
No, we don't.
[SCOTT AND MONTGOMERY SNICKER] [ZACH] So I went to a lot of movies.
What can I get you? I just wanted to say that I am sorry for all of it.
The thing I said about your ass, that wasn't And your compliments and, um I'm just really I'm really sorry.
Thanks.
- You're an asshole, but thanks.
- Yeah.
Mike and Ikes? Yeah.
And Hot Tamales, too, please.
And And a Diet Coke.
[ZACH] I mean, I guess I even saw movies I didn't wanna see.
[SCOFFS] You see a lot of movies.
Yeah.
Well, this 2001 thing is supposed to be a masterpiece, so God, it's, uh so boring.
- Oh, is it? - Yeah, but at least it's long.
You should still see it, though, so at least when pretentious people talk about it, you can yawn really loudly.
Okay.
Cool, yeah.
So [CLEARS THROAT] Thanks.
[THEME FROM 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY PLAYS] So, yeah - that was painful.
- [LAUGHS] Right? You're in space.
Why aren't you having fun in space? Why does nobody talk? Why is the movie so long and nobody talks about anything? I mean, at least talk about the fact that, holy shit, you're in outer space.
Would you ever wanna watch a different movie? - Like - Like with you? Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, I meant with me, as part of the the plan.
Except not at my house.
My mom doesn't let me have girls over.
So, you're inviting me to watch a movie at my house? I mean, they're never gonna make a movie about Cameron taking a day off.
[FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF PLAYS INDISTINCTLY] People underestimate the Camerons of the world.
I mean, they can be surprising.
Everyone thinks when he falls off the diving board that he wants to drown.
But I think he just wanted someone to save him.
- I kind of get that, actually.
- Yeah.
- [OLIVIA] Hannah? - [DOOR CLOSING] - Shit.
My parents are home early.
- Uh Uh Uh, just hide.
Like - [OLIVIA] Hannah, you up? - Oh, fuck.
Honey, are you up? [BOTH CHUCKLE] [ZACH] No.
To my knowledge, her parents never found out.
[SONYA] So you told no one else about the time you spent with Hannah, - isn't that correct? - Yes.
Then isn't it true that you were ashamed of telling anyone? No.
No, I just [SIGHS] That was the summer that my dad died.
And I was out of my mind, and I needed someone that I could talk to.
Yes, but, Zach, didn't you send each other hundreds of text messages? I Hundreds? I mean, I Yeah, we texted.
- [CELL PHONE BEEPS] - [ZACH] I don't know how many times.
[BRYCE] Who is it, Zachy? [GROANS] No one.
It's just my mom.
How's she doing? She okay? She just needs me to come home.
How are you doing? I'm good.
I'm fine.
I'm not good.
My mom My mom doesn't even wanna talk about it.
She's acting like life is just, like, going on.
And, I mean, I know that she's destroyed, and she's worried about the future and everything, but she doesn't say anything about it.
My parents do the same thing.
[ZACH] We just We had things in common to talk about, and things we didn't have to talk about, things we just knew about each other.
[SONYA] That must've been exhausting, keeping that a secret.
Yeah, I guess I, uh I just wanted to keep the friendship ours.
And in all that time you spent together, all those texts, you and Hannah never became more than friends? You never told your fellow teammates about her, as you've said they do? - Bragged a bit? - No.
I would never do that.
Because there was nothing to brag about or because you're not one to do so? Because it wasn't like that.
What was it like then? Mr.
Dempsey, did something happen between you and Hannah Baker the summer before she took her life? - What? Shut up.
- [CHUCKLES] After that, we went on Space Mountain, and I threw up all over her.
And after she broke up with me, I took a long walk through Toon Town.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] Yeah.
How about you? Any bad breakups? Kind of hard to be broken up with when you've never had a boyfriend.
What? Really? I thought you and Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to Everyone thinks I've done a lot of things with a lot of people, but Hey, because I'm a guy, people give me shit because I don't do enough, so And what have you done? - Are you seriously asking? - I am.
Uh, yeah, nothing.
I'm a virgin.
It's weird.
You know, 'cause of my reputation, like, people calling me a slut and everything, it made sex seem bad, like this negative thing.
But I don't want it to be.
I want my first time to be how I want it, not how everyone says it's been.
Yeah.
I actually get that.
[SIGHS] Feels like there's no one good left in this town to even wanna do that with, though.
So, um It's just, I It's just you are a good person, and I like you.
I like you, too.
Sorry, what's happening? I wanna lose my virginity, and I want it to be great.
Like I wanna do it on my terms and with someone that I like.
Would you be interested in having sex? [STAMMERS] Oh! Yes! All right, man, so, who is this girl? She's, uh She's from another school.
- [JUSTIN] Cool.
- Yeah.
So what do you wanna know? Well, what exactly do I need to know? Well, I'm very happy you came to my office for this chat to No, but, seriously, it's hotter when a girl likes what you're doing and she feels good.
["SOUVENIR" PLAYING] [ZACH CHUCKLES] I'm sorry, I don't know how to, um - begin this - [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] thing that we're doing.
- Is that me shaking or you? - Maybe both.
A little bit of both.
[CHUCKLES] It's my direction It's my proposal It's so hard, it's leading me astray - I I hate my body.
- What? - Why? It's beautiful.
- Okay, you have to say that.
No.
I look at your body every day, and I think it's perfect.
My obsession It's my creation You'll understand It's not important now [ZACH] Mm.
Mm-hmm.
[CHUCKLES] - [HANNAH CHUCKLES] - [ZACH GROANS] Uh Okay, yeah.
[SIGHS] [GASPS] - Does it hurt? - Uh Just pressure.
Keep going.
- [ZACH GROANS] - [HANNAH MOANS] It's okay.
It's okay.
All I need is Coordination I can't imagine My destination My intention - Ask my opinion - [ZACH GROANS] There's no excuse My feelings still remain [ZACH EXHALES] [BOTH PANTING] Phew.
Was that, uh Was that okay? Yeah.
It was good.
I could probably do it better if you wanna try again.
We could try again.
Okay.
[BOTH LAUGH] Yes.
- What? - Yes.
We We had sex.
- Just once? - No.
We It was all summer.
But it wasn't just the sex.
We really cared for each other.
["YOUR LOVE" PLAYING] [ZACH] It was amazing I think.
I don't know how Hannah felt about it.
Running like a fire Burning in the wind You say you'll take me higher Higher than I've been It was a feeling So, I've been practicing.
I never wanna live in - Practicing what? - Figuring out what I like.
I had to get past the initial "This is wrong.
God's gonna punish me and all women" feeling of shame.
[CHUCKLES] Which wasn't a joke, but now it's like, literally, the only thing I wanna do.
- [MOANING, PANTING] - I don't want your love If you can breathe without it I don't want your love - Holy shit.
- Right? - This is all starting to make sense now.
- Right? I don't know the way - The way that you feel about me - [BOTH CHUCKLE] I don't wanna stay If you can be free without me Don't wanna give it up Don't wanna give it up If you can give it back - Hey.
- Hey.
I never was a dreamer Never wanted to pretend When the night comes, I still feel you In my dreams, you never end And I want you to be with me And I want you to be free And I want you to remember That I don't want you To fall too hard I don't want your love Hey, do you think we're doing this too much? Do you think we are? No.
I mean, do you think so? - Are you okay with all this? - I'm good.
- So should we? Okay.
- Yeah.
Yes.
[CAR BEEPS] I, uh I'm gonna meet with Dennis.
- Damage control.
- I'd like to come.
Fine.
We're meeting at my house.
I don't want you to feel alone in this, Liv.
Well, that's nice, Andy.
[CHUCKLES] I'm honored by your concern.
Can you not give one inch? I'm trying here.
Is there not one goddamn ounce of forgiveness somewhere? Some Some kind of understanding that not everybody else is as self-contained as you are? Forgiveness for what? For which part? - The leaving or the not fighting? - This is you, though.
This is our whole life together.
Not just this trial, not just Hannah.
You have never forgiven weakness, or imperfection, or struggle.
I forgave every weakness, every imperfection, every mistake that we made in parenting our daughter.
I guess I'm just surprised that's all we had.
I lied to you.
I am living with Valerie and her daughter.
I know.
[GLASS SHATTERING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - [FRONT DOOR OPENS] - [INTRUDER RUSTLING] [MATT] Clay, are you home? - What the hell? - Aah! It wasn't me! Who the hell are you? [STUDENT] "Frequent sexual intercourse.
" That's what it says.
[ZACH] I never told anyone because Well, I thought I was protecting Hannah.
Maybe I was just protecting myself.
What the fuck? [BOYS CHUCKLING] I mean, what gives, Dempsey? You cash in on your v-card, and you don't tell your best friend? - What the fuck, Bryce? What the fuck? - It's a joke.
Lighten the fuck up.
- What the hell is wrong with you? - Hey.
Hey! Same team, same team.
Chill out.
What's going on, you two? It's nothing, Coach.
All right.
If it's nothing, I don't wanna see that kind of behavior in here again.
And I don't wanna see it out there.
Hear me? That goes for all of us.
Okay? I don't care who the hell you are out there.
You step into this room, you step across that baseline, you are the Liberty Tigers.
The end.
Yeah? [STUDENTS] Yeah.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Olivia, I just don't think we should call him.
I mean, Sonya will tear him apart.
They must know everything about the kid, right? And we don't.
Lainie did recuse herself, but that's Somehow, I'm not concerned about a mother knowing her son's secrets.
That tends not to be the case these days, it seems, with mothers.
Liv Our daughter I mean, she becomes a woman, and we missed it? [ANDY] But is this the right response? We put another kid on the stand and hope for the best? There's a reason why we kept him off the list.
Clay was devastated when Hannah died, okay? He was in love with her.
He thought she was perfect.
The jury needs to hear that.
All right, we'll have to prep him tonight.
Go ahead and fill out the paperwork.
I'll talk to him first.
What the fuck did you do? Why would you say all of that? You just made everything worse for her.
I didn't mean to.
Clay, I swear to God, it's not a lie.
- I'm sorry.
- So how come no one knew about it? - You were out of town last summer.
- It wasn't on your tape.
She put everything on your tape? You didn't deserve her.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Fuck you.
You just go to hell.
- Clay, come on, man.
- Get the fuck out of here! [CAR ENGINE STARTING] You have something you wanna say to me? [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Hey.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
It's called The Clubhouse.
- Wait, what? - The place in the Polaroids.
It's called The Clubhouse.
Jesus.
I don't care anymore.
What? - How do you go from? - Look, I don't fucking care, okay? I'm done.
[CELL PHONE VIBRATING] I have to take this.
So, I'll see you.
All right, put your guns down, guys.
Guns on the table.
We're gonna put in a fresh clip, okay? Cyrus, look at this.
We're going to eject the old clip like that by pressing that button.
Roll in the new clip like so.
Rack the slide.
Okay? - You guys try it.
- Cool.
Remember, even if there's no clip in there, always treat your guns as if they're loaded.
- Okay? - Yeah.
All right.
Give it a shot.
I really appreciate this.
My wife didn't think it was appropriate to call, but we don't know anybody else we could ask, and Alex has been a good friend to Tyler.
Oh, well, I'm happy to do it.
Tyler's a good kid.
You know, we can't change the past, but we can be better, right? [GUNSHOT] Dude, what the fuck? I've been waiting outside for, like, 30 minutes.
I'm plateauing.
- Plateauing? - Yeah.
Apparently, that happens when you shoot yourself in the head.
After, like, six months, no matter how much work you put in, your body just settles into being broken forever.
Come on.
You had a rough couple days It's not a rough couple of days, Zach.
This is my life now.
My doctor said so.
Pretty sure your doctor didn't say that.
Well, I can't testify.
I can't help Hannah, I can't help Jess.
I'm useless.
Well, maybe that's for the better.
What is that supposed to mean? After what happened to me today, - maybe you don't wanna testify.
- Don't tell me what I fucking want.
- Alex - Man, at least you can do it.
And at least you can walk and fuck girls.
Fuck.
- Alex.
- Fuck you! - Alex, don't - Get the fuck off of me! Fuck my leg and this fucking hole in my head.
And then fuck Justin for coming back for Jessica.
- And fuck Jessica, too! - Look, man, just - No! Get off of me! - Come on.
Alex, stop.
- Fight me! Man, fight me! - Calm down, Alex.
- Just I'm not gonna - Fuck you! - Whoa! Stop, stop, stop! - What? What's wrong? What's wrong? I, uh [ZACH] I, um [STUTTERING] Man Uh, listen.
It's probably just like, from the physical contact and, um Are you okay? Yeah.
Yeah, I am.
My dick works.
[CHUCKLES] Yeah.
[BOTH PANTING] We need you to talk about your friendship.
About what you two meant to each other.
Her kindness.
Will they ask me about kissing her? They probably will.
But it was just one kiss.
It's important that the jury understands who Hannah really was.
Dennis will ask you what you two talked about, the hopes and dreams that Hannah shared with you, her good qualities.
This trial I mean, I've learned things about Hannah I guess I didn't know before.
I understand.
Me, too.
I feel like I didn't really know who she was.
Can you put all of that out of your mind, though, and focus on who Hannah really was to you? [JESSICA] I couldn't move.
He got on top of me, and I couldn't move my arms.
Or if I did, he'd just push them back down.
He just kept pushing everywhere.
He wouldn't listen.
I can still feel his hands taking off my underwear.
I just feel him all the time.
If I kiss someone, I can feel his breath.
If I touch someone, I just remember trying to get him not to touch me.
God.
So it's really fucking stupid that I'm worried about Justin when he's one of the goddamn reasons why I'm dealing with all of this shit.
[SNIFFLES] [ZACH] You fool yourself into thinking that by keeping things hidden, it makes it easier for you to get by.
[CALEB] people looking at me right now, facing the other side, and the twos will be with their backs to me.
Let's face our partners.
Let the ones be aggressors, let's have them grab at the neck.
The twos break the grip, throw the palm, grab the shoulders, throw the knee.
- [GRUNTING] - There you go.
Speed it up.
Here, Lucas, you can switch with Selena for a second.
Thank you.
All right? One more time.
You're gonna grab my neck.
We're gonna break the grip, we're gonna throw the palm, throw the knee.
All right? We'll switch, and this is with the sound.
Ready? Grab my neck.
[GRUNTING] - There you go.
You good? - Yeah.
Get back in line.
Selena, switch over.
The twos are the aggressors.
[ZACH] Even though you know you'd feel a lot better if you just came clean.
[HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Don't drink it so fast.
That's a one-way trip to barf town.
- [CHUCKLES] - [GROANS] - Sounds fun.
- Not so, my friend.
[CYRUS] It is done.
You hacked Zach's iCloud account in two minutes? His password was "zachattack," so [SCOFFS] [CYRUS] Isn't that the girl that died? Yeah.
That's weird.
What's that? [BOYS CHANTING] Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! - Holy shit.
- This is incredible.
[CHANTING CONTINUES ON VIDEO] - We have to send this everywhere.
- No.
No, no, no.
No, let's fuck with him first.
No, I mean, I think I think you're really brave to talk about Justin.
Is there anyone else you wanna talk about? - Bryce maybe? - Bryce? [SCOFFS] What do you mean? Look I've been the girl who's avoided her rapist in the halls.
Mine was a senior named Mark Perry.
And it's a story for another time, but I'm choosing to say his name to you even though I didn't turn him in.
You wanna know why? Because it's my fucking story to tell.
No one else's.
And you should be so proud that you told yours tonight.
- I am.
- Good.
You know, just know that you can always, always talk about it with me.
I get it.
Hugs.
Look, I was trying to help Hannah's case.
[LAINIE] By hiding Justin here? In the home of a lawyer whose firm is trying the case? Do you have any idea how that could look? It's not just appearances we're worried about.
Matt, I'm an officer of the court.
Justin failed to respond to his subpoena.
He's in contempt.
Look, I was hiding him here because I didn't have any other options, okay? What about the option of coming to talk to us as promised? I had nowhere to go.
That's why he had no other options.
My mom is a junkie.
And her boyfriend is He's a dealer and not a very nice guy.
I knew that they wouldn't take me back.
Clay and Tony, they found me and saved me.
He didn't tell you guys because I was too ashamed for anyone to know.
[COUGHS] And he's sick with the flu, which is why we were waiting for him to testify.
You can stay as long as you need, Justin.
But I will need to report you being back to the lawyers.
- I'm sorry, it's the law.
- That's okay.
I understand.
Thank you, Mrs.
Jensen and Mr.
Jensen.
Now who's hungry? [MACKENZIE] Really? You threw up on his favorite boots.
What were you guys drinking? 'Cause he is out cold.
Uh, he said it was his special recipe.
[BOTH LAUGH] What were you guys even working on? Um You got a little There you go.
He's gonna hate me.
Why? I'm not telling him what happened.
You don't have to either, you know? It could just be our secret.
Like just me and you.
Okay.
Thanks.
Yeah.
What are we paying the Walkers' lawyer for if you're just gonna keep secrets from him? And this was happening all last summer? - No, I wasn't ready.
[SIGHS] - And save.
[CAMERA CLICKS] No, I'm not ready.
[WHINES] I don't wanna go back to school.
Junior year's like the only year that counts on your transcript.
[CELL PHONE BEEPS] Oh, Bryce is back and wants to party.
If you want, we can hang with him later.
I don't have plans.
Actually I don't want my friends to know about this.
Us.
I just kind of want this to be ours, you know? Um yeah, okay.
Why would you keep this from me? - 'Cause that's how we do things, isn't it? - What does that mean? I don't even know how you feel about Dad dying.
I don't know how you feel about anything.
What if I felt like Hannah did? Because I have, Mom.
I actually have.
- What would you do? - Zachary Shan-Yung Dempsey, that is enough.
Don't say such things.
- Why not? - This trial That girl has put thoughts in your head.
You do not feel that way.
You're fine.
Yeah, exactly.
[SNIFFLES] I'm fine.
Well, what about Jessica's party? I mean, you didn't talk to him there.
He was drunk and stupid by the time I showed up.
So why didn't you put it on his tape? Maybe I was keeping it private for me and him.
- Or maybe you were protecting yourself.
- Yes.
I mean, maybe I was.
Maybe it hurt that it meant something to me and not to him.
If I had been in town that summer would it have been me instead? [DOOR OPENING] You thinking about Zach? What? No.
I read that stupid blog.
I have to tell hundreds of people tomorrow what I loved about Hannah, and all I can think about is how she lost her virginity to Zach.
I mean, Zach.
Then, like, a month later, she hooked up with me, and then she freaked out.
But she didn't freak out when she hooked up with Zach? I mean What the fuck are you saying, Jensen? I mean, do you know how many girls I've slept with? Like, a lot.
Classifies me as, like, a player or something and my best friends used to think I was the fucking best.
Okay.
Hannah, she sleeps with one guy.
She has a crush on another guy, being me, and she kisses a third, being you.
And it's whatever, it's all fine, right? All of a sudden, she's a slut? All of a sudden, you don't know who she is? - You're a dumbass.
- I'm not a dumbass.
You're dumb.
You're an ass.
Dumbass.
I'm not the dumbass who got locked out of the house today.
Clay, I didn't get locked out today.
Someone broke in.
I I didn't see who it was, and I didn't tell your parents.
What the fuck? I mean, who the fuck have you pissed off lately? Bryce.
It has to be Bryce.
Did he leave anything, or did he take anything? Fuck.
I don't I was downstairs with your parents this whole Fuck.
- What is it? - Wha? Nothing.
It's It's good.
Everything's here.
[ZACH] Hannah had nothing to be ashamed of.
I made her feel like she did.
Because I don't tell people things, like I said.
[BRYCE] Five tickets for Sudden Descent, please.
Hey, are you still wearing that lacy, black underwear? [WILLEM] Yeah, come on, show us.
Oh.
Miles and miles of skin.
- [BRYCE] All right, ladies.
Enough.
- [MONTGOMERY] What? It makes me feel free.
Yeah, just keep the change.
Thank you, sweetheart.
So, yeah [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [ZACH] Shit.
I forgot my wallet, guys.
- I'll meet you out there.
- [BRYCE] All right.
Hey.
Sorry about earlier.
I didn't want them to make fun of you or anything.
They made fun of me anyway.
Right.
I'm sorry about that.
Can I make it up to you, uh, sometime? Uh, you were right before.
Maybe it's best if we just keep this thing between us.
You know, if we end it now, then it stays good.
Not complicated.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, that sounds good.
Okay.
Cool.
[ZACH] Hannah didn't tell me how she felt either.
But now I guess I know.
And I'll be ashamed for the rest of my life.
And shame burns.
["HAD TO HEAR" PLAYS] [ALISHA BOE] For help finding crisis resources, visit 13reasonswhy.

Well done.

1 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [HANNAH] It's a giant fucking universe.
[CLAY] It is a giant universe.
[HANNAH] Like, how are we supposed to do anything significant? Anything that means anything? We're not even dots.
But, somehow, every day feels like life or death, right? Even though, at some level, it also feels like nothing matters at all.
Or means anything.
And, like, in a real way, we're all just accidents of birth, you know? Like, it's just dumb luck that we're not having this conversation somewhere much worse than this basement.
Like, some shantytown in South Asia, or the frozen north of Iceland, or a burning desert in Africa.
But that's it.
We are exactly who we are, in this moment, in this place, and I think that matters.
Because without you, without me, everything is different.
I don't know if anything would be different without me.
I would be different.
Okay, if I do something, it affects you.
Makes you do something that affects, I don't know, Alex Standall, who affects Jessica Davis.
[CLAY] Who affects Justin Foley, then Zach Dempsey, then Mrs.
Bradley, - and then Tony Padilla - [HANNAH] And on and on.
[CLAY] It's huge if you think about it.
[HANNAH] It's an infinite universe.
[CLAY] Infinity.
It's funny we have a word for that concept, but there's no way we can understand it.
- Maybe love? - Love? Maybe love is how you understand infinity.
When your love has no limit.
When it goes on forever.
Maybe that feels like infinity.
Yeah.
Maybe.
[ALARM CLOCK RINGING] [CLAY] Hey, Skye.
It's, uh It's me again.
Clay.
Calling you.
Nothing much new to report.
I go to court today.
To testify.
For Hannah.
Still dealing with Justin.
This is weird.
You should have some pancakes.
They're fucking amazing.
[MATT] I'll get you a plate.
Clay, your dad's going to take you to court today.
[EXHALES] Great.
- I wish I could be there as well.
- Really no problem.
I've got this.
And you've got alt-Clay here, so But, I mean, things are actually great.
I'm glad to be going to court, and I really think it's going to be a good way to get closure.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to being done with all this.
I love you.
Call me.
Bye.
[MRS.
STANDALL] Alex, honey? Wake up.
Wake up.
- Alexander.
- What? What happened? - Sorry, you were sleeping so soundly.
- [SIGHS] Sorry, I was dreaming about running.
Happy birthday.
- Oh, wow.
- [LAUGHS] Right.
Thanks.
So I heard from Peter, and he is driving down this afternoon to be here in time for the party.
Oh.
Do we have to have a party? But it's all booked, and your father got his shift off.
Haven't you told your friends? Well, yeah, I mean Plus, they got your e-vite with the bunnies on it.
- You not feeling up to it? - No, I am.
I totally am.
Good.
We'll have fun.
All right.
Get yourself up, do your stretches.
[GASPS] And I have a new hemp milk to try.
It's delicious.
[DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] You should come for a morning run next time.
[CHUCKLES] I don't run unless I'm being chased.
And even then, I don't run.
You ran pretty fast last night.
Yeah, uh I'm sorry.
I got a text from Mrs.
Baker, and I had to go No excuses needed.
Look, I don't wanna tie you down.
And I don't want you to think you owe me anything.
But I like you.
A lot, I think.
- I'm done early tonight.
- Hmm.
No self-defense class.
- That's quite a group you got there.
- Yeah.
Yeah, right? The, uh, the guy with no eye, what's his deal? I don't know, really.
He got beat pretty bad a while back.
I think it was mugging or something.
He takes a few classes.
I think he's working through the PTSD from the assault.
Seems pretty haunted by it.
Jesus.
- Does he remember much? - Haven't spoken to him about it.
- There's lots of stories in that class.
- I bet.
Aren't we going the wrong way for your first period? Uh, I thought we'd take the long way today.
- Why is Zach waiting for us? - [CHUCKLES] - And why is he smiling like that? What? - [LAUGHS] - Wait, is it your birthday? - [JESSICA] Whoo! - What? - What? [ZACH, JESSICA LAUGH] - You guys got a banner made? - It was a group project.
I made the design, Clay ordered it online, and Zach put it up.
Wow, that's [CHUCKLES] that's really, really nice, you guys.
[BRYCE] Aw.
Happy birthday, buddy.
Oh, sweet banner.
Is your mom bringing cupcakes? I hope she brings enough for the whole class.
Maybe you'll get a new cane this year too, huh? [CHUCKLING] Yeah.
And some new friends.
[ALEX] Fuck you! You fucking rapist! Dude, shit like that doesn't do anybody any good.
Yeah? Well, it felt good to me.
Maybe if you'd stop defending him all the time.
- When have I ever defended him? - Every day.
Every day you hang around him and play baseball with him, you choose his side.
Jess, tell him.
Why would you do that? Shit.
I'm so sorry.
- I mean - Jess.
Don't.
Come on, didn't you see the red light? - It means you're not - Hey.
Uh, hi.
- Sorry.
- No, uh, you're No big deal.
I know what the red light means.
[CHUCKLES] So, um, last night was really fun.
We should, maybe, do it again sometime.
We should clean vomit off your brother's boots? We should hang out.
Maybe not in the bathroom.
So, hang out in your yard? Or another building.
Restaurant.
Movie theater, perhaps? - Do you mean, like a - I mean, like a date.
It's an early stage in the mating ritual of homo sapiens.
We agree to go somewhere together.
I obsess over what to wear and then you obsess over if you should pay or if we're splitting it.
We show up, it either goes great or it goes terrible, and then we decide if we wanna put ourselves through it again.
What sadistic person invented this ritual? [MACKENZIE CHUCKLES] Every person.
- So, you wanna? - Um Yes.
I I really do.
She was faithful.
She was kind to me and cared about what happened to me.
She never gossiped, or told lies about people.
And what sorts of things did you do together? We had some classes together, we ate lunch together sometimes, and we worked together at the Crestmont.
And we talked, a lot.
- What did you talk about? - We talked about about books and shows and songs and eclipses and zombies and bike helmets and and I guess our our hopes and dreams.
[HANNAH] Helmet.
Helmet.
Helmet.
If you don't help build this tower, you don't get to knock it down.
I I just need to finish this chapter.
Do you really have homework? School's over in, like, two days.
All we do in my classes is watch Stand and Deliver.
I wanna get the summer reading done before I, um, leave for my grandparents' for the summer.
Wait, what? My parents think it's good for a "growing boy" to spend time in the country.
[SCOFFS] We don't exactly live in a thriving metropolis.
Ten minutes at my grandparents', and you would disagree.
[CHUCKLES] What am I supposed to do all summer without you? - Wait, you're you're gonna miss me? - Of course.
You're the only friend I have left.
Come on, that's not true.
Will you write me, like, old-school letters? Yeah.
I mean, can I write them on the computer and print them? You may not.
And no postcards.
I want handwritten missives filled with your deepest, darkest secrets.
Are you gonna write me back? "Dear Helmet, today, someone smeared feces on the bathroom wall, and I got to clean it up.
But there was an expired box of Milk Duds that I got to take home for free.
" Those are your deepest and darkest secrets? Write me, and you'll find out.
- Whoa! - [LAUGHS] I never wrote her.
I just Summer gets away from you, and stuff happens.
And I guess I didn't really think that she'd be thinking of me.
I mean, I didn't think I was that important.
And you always think that you think that you'll have plenty of time.
[WHIMPERS] I'm sorry.
- What the hell? - Whatever happened to "What happens in The Clubhouse stays in The Clubhouse"? Not in here.
Jesus.
- What the fuck is your problem? - Somebody's blackmailing me.
If my dad sees that, I'm dead.
Fuck.
Look, you need to help me shut this down.
- I need to? - You owe me.
I don't owe anybody anything, Marcus.
I got a lot of eyes on me right now, okay? I can't get involved in some stripper shit.
- You're already involved.
You were there.
- I'm not in the video.
Are you fucking kidding me? After what I did for you in court, you can't return the favor? A favor's only a favor if someone asks for it.
And I didn't ask you to drag my name into this shit.
That's on you.
[SCHOOL BELL RINGS] Clay, you've testified today that Hannah was a victim of a culture of bullying at Liberty High.
But isn't it true that you are also a part of that culture? No, I don't think I am.
Isn't it true that you took pictures of Tyler Down through his window that you then circulated around the school via social media? - Yes, but - [DENNIS] Objection, Your Honor.
Beyond the scope of the direct.
Your Honor, he's already testified to the nature of bullying at Liberty.
[JUDGE] I'll allow it.
[SONYA] Clay, isn't it true that you were suspended from school for possession of marijuana? - It wasn't mine.
I was set up.
- I see.
And at any point subsequent to that suspension, did you attempt to buy more marijuana? - Yes, but I was - And isn't it true that your vandalism caused thousands of dollars of damage to Zach Dempsey's car? I was angry at him.
I I paid for the damage.
What did you do when you were angry at Courtney Crimsen? I just took her to Hannah's grave.
And isn't it true that you accused her of being responsible for Hannah's death? She is responsible.
All of those kids are responsible.
Are you responsible, Clay? Are you responsible for Hannah's death? Yes, I am.
I let her down.
But there are kids who did a lot worse, kids who you let skate, who did things you won't even talk about.
And adults at Liberty don't [SONYA] Request to strike that as non-responsive.
[JUDGE] So ordered.
The jury will ignore that answer.
Clay, you've testified that you were Hannah's friend but never her boyfriend.
- Is that correct? - Yes.
And you said that you kissed once.
- Is that correct? - Yes.
Did you ever spend a night together? You mean, have have sex? No.
No.
I mean, spend a night together, evening, night, into the next morning.
Clay, did you and Hannah ever spend a night together? Yes.
And did you do drugs together? Yes.
- [MUSIC PLAYING] - [STUDENTS CHEERING] Go, Tigers! - Hey! Go, Tigers! - Yeah! Hey! Go, Tigers! [AIR HORN BLARES] Hey! Go, Tigers! Hey! Go, Tigers! [CHEERING] [CHLOE] Let's give it up for our varsity baseball team! [STUDENT] Go, Tigers! - [STUDENT] Oh, look at him.
- [AUDIENCE] Aww.
Hey, how about a hand for our new cheer captain, Chloe Rice? [CHEERING] So sweet.
And now, for our emcee of today's assembly, Marcus Cole! - [CHEERING] - [MUSIC PLAYING] That's right.
That's right.
I, uh dressed for the occasion.
Who's impressed? [CHEERING] He turned it into a fucking publicity stunt.
He's got this whole fucking school brainwashed.
We have to do something else, man.
Okay? Something bigger.
What did you have in mind? I'm sorry, Dad.
For what, kiddo? For telling the truth? For not telling you stuff.
And what did you say? I didn't I didn't know what to say.
I You know there's nothing you could do, nothing that would stop your mother and me from loving you.
You heard Hannah say this, and you did nothing? I didn't think she meant it like that.
Why is it kids don't tell their parents anything, ever? Is it shame? Or fear? It can't be fear of punishment.
No one's punished for anything anymore.
Are you afraid we won't understand? More like afraid you'd understand too well.
So you're protecting your secrets? We were all still recovering From drugs.
And that explains why you did nothing? Or we're protecting you.
Look, I have to get to school.
Let's welcome this year's varsity track team! - [STUDENTS CHEERING] - [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLAY] Hey, Skye.
Me again.
Court was not great.
They found out about this thing Hannah said one time, and they blew it way out of proportion.
But now I can't stop thinking about the morning she said it and the night we spent before.
[JEFF] Hey, Jensen.
Don't you have a class to get to? - Don't you guys? - No, man.
We just won State.
They don't make us go to school anymore.
Yeah, you wish.
I'm wondering why after such an excellent pep rally, it seems like your pep has not been rallied.
[CHUCKLES] - I'm not a pep sort, I guess.
- Okay.
I didn't see you sit next to Hannah.
I never sit next to Hannah.
You always try to.
[CHUCKLES] Not lately.
Remember that poem that everyone was talking about? Everyone was talking about a poem? How is that possible? Who talks about poems? [STAMMERS] I Anyway I made fun of it.
And I didn't know it was hers, and Man, if you and Hannah's relationship were a novel, a major theme would be "mistakes.
" Thank you.
We'll figure this out.
The last time I took your advice, she ran out on me at the dance.
No, no, no, no, that wasn't my fault, all right? If I recall correctly, it was your nerves and uptight nature that just ruined everything.
Look, you both are just too hung up on shit.
We'll work on this.
I don't have an uptight nature.
[BOTH CHUCKLE] You know what? We're gonna have a gathering this weekend.
Me, you, Hannah, my girl, Leah, and some friends.
I'll text you.
- I don't really do parties.
- Oh, you'll do this one.
See you Saturday, Jensen.
We're taking State this year.
And it's for him.
He was what a teammate should be.
Loyal.
- Yeah, he always had your back.
- Never had to wonder about that.
And he looked out for people.
Always took care of his guys, no questions asked.
- Yeah.
- Right.
[CLAY] I just keep thinking did I miss something huge, like I did with you? What are you doing here? I stayed to watch them hang Jeff's jersey.
Yeah, me, too.
How'd it go, in court? Not well.
- I'm sorry.
- They asked me about the party at Jeff's.
Before summer, last year.
Oh, shit.
How'd they know about that? God, no, Clay.
I would never.
I swear.
Someone must've brought it up at their deposition.
Maybe Leah.
It doesn't matter now.
Was there anything in your text messages? No.
Why? Well, 'cause the other night, your mom, she was asking me about a text.
She said it was for a case she was working on.
Look, anyways, I'm sure it's not as bad as you think it is.
It's worse.
[REGISTER CLICKS] [CLAY] And, like, what other signs have I missed? - [MAN] Call if you have questions.
- [DEPUTY STANDALL] Got it.
- Good seeing you.
- Thanks, man.
Let's go, bud.
You good? Oh, hey, there he is.
- Tyler, good to see you.
- Good to see you too, sir.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Baker Drugs.
This is a little out of your way, yeah? Yeah.
Uh, they carry some stuff that the WalPlex doesn't, so Uh, so we're gonna see you at the party tonight? Oh, I I didn't know, so I thought that you invited all your friends.
Yeah, well, Jessica was supposed to It's at the Epicenter tonight.
Come if you can.
Alex would love to have you there.
- I don't know.
I don't wanna - [ALEX] You should come.
- Really.
You should.
- Yeah? [BOTH] Yeah.
- Okay.
Yeah, I'll be there.
- [DEPUTY STANDALL] Good.
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.
- Right on.
- Later.
Later.
Don't they do any fucking maintenance at this place? - [ANDY] Olivia.
- Seriously.
With what we pay for this plot? I'll speak to them on the way out.
They promised weekly maintenance.
- They can't even cut the fucking grass.
- Liv.
Liv.
[SIGHS] This day, Andy I don't I'm not even sure how well that kid knew Hannah.
He knew her well.
I think he was in love with her.
He's a good kid.
Yeah, who encouraged her to do some bad things.
One.
One thing, and it wasn't it wasn't that bad.
Nothing that you and you and I didn't do in high school.
But what she said to him the next morning I've said to myself over the years.
Was it my fault, Andy? Did I? Was she sick? Did I give something to her? - God, no.
- The women in my family Stop, Liv.
Just stop.
Our Hannah was very happy.
She was kind, intelligent, beautiful, and she was very, very happy.
That's our Hannah.
[OLIVIA SOBS] We were happy, weren't we? We were happy.
Andy Andy Should we go have some dinner? These are kinda cute.
- They're all right.
- I need more yoga pants.
I mean, how many pairs of yoga pants does one person need? - I mean, do you even do yoga? - I do, I - All right.
Shut up.
- [LAUGHS] How long have you been together? Uh, it'll be five months next Thursday.
Damn.
Has it been that long already? Wow, okay.
Don't act so excited now.
- Uh - [LAUGHS] See, that's her way of saying, "I can't get enough of you, baby.
" Wow.
You guys are adorable.
And by that, I mean disgusting.
[CHUCKLES] I'll let you guys do your thing.
- All right.
Thanks.
- All right.
So is he, like, in college, or? [NINA] Uh, junior college.
But he's transferring to Berkeley for fall semester.
Pre-law.
- Shit.
He's kind of amazing.
- I know, right? But, I mean, hey, I deserve amazing.
So do you, by the way.
Whenever you're ready to get back out there.
[BRYCE] Shh.
Shh.
Don't worry about it.
- Just having fun.
- What are you doing? Please! Don't worry about it.
- Just having fun.
- What are you doing? Please! [GASPS] [JESSICA] Please.
No.
[PANTING] [SOBBING] [ALARM BEEPING] Jessica! Hey.
Hey.
What's You need to pay for that.
Uh, no, here, it was an accident.
I'm sorry.
She's not buying it.
Jess.
Hey.
- [JESSICA] I'm sorry.
[PANTING] - [ALARM STOPS] It's okay.
It's okay.
Are you okay? Yeah, must have been a trigger or something.
Security tag triggered the alarm.
It's no big deal.
Are you sure you're okay? Um, babe, can you get us some gelato, actually? Please? - Good idea.
- Thank you so much.
- My treat.
- Thanks.
He knows how we know each other, right? Uh, well, yeah.
School.
I don't let what happened to me define me.
So why should I tell him when it's not who I am? Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
- [OLIVIA] Haven't been here in a while.
- It didn't feel right at first.
How's the store? Uh, yeah, I was able to find some new distributors for a lot of the items so we could compete, price-wise.
Cosmetics, for one, so - That's great.
- Yeah.
And the new pharmacist? He's good.
He's young, so he knows the medicine part, but not the people part.
What about you? How's WalPlex? - Getting used to it.
- Yeah.
I realized that I liked being my own boss, or letting you be the boss.
- I don't know the right way to say this.
- Just say it, Andy.
We need to finalize things, Liv.
We can't stay in limbo forever.
This is about the divorce? I don't wanna wait till after the trial.
We need to move on.
- You wanna marry her.
- No.
I want I wanna close a door that I can never go back through.
Yes.
I see.
[CLAY] Hey, Skye.
It's me.
Again.
Listen, I don't know if you get news there.
Uh, you might hear about about stuff I did that came out in court.
It's kind of bad.
Good.
- Hungry? - Uh, sure.
Why not? Are you out of your mind? No.
Dude, listen.
- You know my body's a temple, right? - I don't think about your body.
What I mean is you know how healthy I am.
- You're an athlete.
- Yeah, and a damn good one.
But on the rare occasion, when I want a deep, lovely night with my lady, we'll do a little love drug.
I've read that that shit can fry your brain, like, first time you try it.
And riding your bike without a helmet can kill you.
But which one's gonna help you let loose and help you get past your shit with Hannah and into each other? - Hmm? - This is peer pressure.
No, no.
I don't wanna pressure you.
You put too much pressure on yourself.
I mean that's the whole point.
You agonize over every decision.
I do not.
Are you sure? I mean, we don't know where these drugs come from, or even what drugs they are.
The way you say "drugs" makes you sound like a Republican senator.
I'm just saying, we don't we don't have to do this.
You know, we can go hang out somewhere else, or Sure.
I mean, if you want to.
But aren't you curious? [ALEX] I'm telling you, Clay.
It's a very good idea for you.
Water? Guys, what if we just ate a bunch of sugar and caffeine? - That's a certain kind of high, right? - Seriously, do not worry.
All right.
Here you go.
Three first-timers, three veterans.
We got you guys.
Totally.
This is so peer pressure.
Like, at its worst.
[VIDEO MACHINE BEEPING] Uh, so tell me the truth.
How's he doing, guys? - He's good.
- Yeah? His balance is getting better and so is his strength.
I mean, he's still working on his memory, but But he's doing great.
[DEPUTY STANDALL] You only need one hand to whoop your old man at Skee-Ball.
- [PETER] Hey.
- Yep.
You should've challenged me at Dance Dance Revolution.
It's my birthday.
You're supposed to laugh at my jokes.
[MRS.
STANDALL] All right.
Wings.
Yeah.
- Fries.
And curly fries.
- All right.
- Burgers will come up when they're ready.
- Thanks, Mom.
Thank you.
You got all your game cards? Yeah.
Yeah, thank you, Mrs.
Standall.
[ZACH] Hey.
Jess.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Yeah? He can go.
He's good.
Hey.
I won this for you just to say sorry about today.
You didn't have to do that.
Yeah, well, if I hadn't won it, I'd just be saying sorry, and I thought maybe the cuteness would help.
Look, we don't need to talk about it.
[JESSICA] Hey.
[MRS.
STANDALL] Hi, sweetie.
How are you? [DEPUTY STANDALL] Great to see you.
[JESSICA] Hi.
How are you? - [ALL LAUGHING] - I just think it's complicated.
See, the thing is to be in the group, but not about the group, you know what I mean? - No.
What do you mean? - All right.
Take Alex.
[LAUGHS] You're friends with Justin Foley.
[LAUGHS] Which is, like, whatever.
And he says you're a good guy.
He doesn't say that about most people.
He doesn't.
It's 'cause he's a dick.
[LAUGHTER] I just feel, like, tremendous positivity for everyone right now.
Mmm.
Exactly.
In fact, I think it's time that a few of us actually slip off for a while.
- Sound good? - Totally.
- Wait.
Wait, no.
Wait.
Where are you? - [JEFF, LEAH LAUGH] [JEFF] Enjoy your night.
It's already a great night.
I agree.
[CHUCKLES] It's like It's like everything is what it is, but, like, more.
- Like, touching touching things.
- I know.
[GASPING] [ARCADE GAME NOISES CONTINUE] For someone who hates parties, I go to a lot of parties.
Yeah.
And it never ends well.
Nope.
[SIGHS] What is he doing here? - No, Alex told me to come.
- Tyler, he was just being nice.
He doesn't want you here.
I wanna talk to Alex.
Okay, look, I brought him something.
What? "Oh, happy birthday, Alex.
Here's a photo book of you in a coma"? He told you about that? Get out.
Now.
Wait.
Where is Tyler going? - Don't worry.
We got rid of him.
- No, I told him to come.
Alex, look, I know he visited you a lot in the hospital, - but he's a fucking pervert.
- After what he did to Hannah [CLAY] What he did? Seriously? At least Tyler tried to help Hannah in court.
That's more than you can say, Zach.
You helped turn her into Hannah the Slut.
- At least we didn't do drugs.
- You guys, come on.
You come on.
You didn't help either.
- I tried.
- From what you said today in court, you hurt her more than any of us.
- They took that out of context.
- [ALEX] So you didn't let her down? How are you any different than us? What are you thinking about? What are you thinking about? Come on, tell me.
What are you thinking about? - I I don't know.
- [UPBEAT GUITAR SONG PLAYING] You're not saying.
I have so many thoughts.
Give me one.
[GROANING] [CHUCKLES] Infinity.
It's an infinity ceiling? No.
It totally is.
Look at it.
Infinity.
It's funny how we have a word for that concept, but there's no way we can understand it.
Maybe love.
Love? Maybe love is how you understand infinity.
When your love has no limits, when it goes on forever.
Maybe that feels like infinity.
Huh.
Yeah, maybe.
How are you feeling? [CHUCKLES] I feel fucking great.
[BOTH LAUGH] At this moment, I am not afraid of anything.
- I am fearless.
- Yeah.
I feel peaceful.
- But it's just the drug, right? - Is it? Didn't these feelings have to be somewhere inside of us for the drug to find them? I'm not sure that's how it works.
Do you believe we have a soul? I don't know.
I hope so.
If you could see the future, would you wanna see the future? No.
- You answered that fast.
- [CHUCKLES] Well Like, can I change the future? Because if I can see it and I know what's coming, and there's nothing I can do about it, then it's just anxiety.
You can always change the future.
So you don't believe in destiny? I do.
I just believe it can change.
This is the saddest birthday party ever.
[CELL PHONE RINGING, VIBRATING] Shit.
Uh, I gotta take this.
Hey, Mom.
Yeah, no, I'm just out with the guys.
I'll be home soon.
Yeah.
No, I know, I know.
[SIGHS] Okay.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Bye.
"The guys"? You're out with the guys? I just told her I'd go home and watch May.
Home from what? Why'd you lie about where you are? I wasn't sure Of course you should lie to her and everybody 'cause that's better than admitting you're my friend? - She knows you're my friend.
- Bryce know where you are? - Come on, man.
- Fuck you, Zach.
- Okay.
- Go home.
Yeah, I should.
Um Thank you guys for having me.
[DEPUTY STANDALL] You don't have to go.
I'm gonna go play some games.
All right, you guys, truth now.
What the hell's going on? He's not all right.
Uh [CLEARS THROAT] I think he does pretty well, most days.
Bullshit.
You said he made progress.
He hasn't made any since the day I saw him last.
- A month ago.
- [MRS.
STANDALL] He's trying.
Oh, he's really trying.
Oh, shit.
[LOUD GAME GUNFIRE] Hey, buddy.
- What are you doing? - Just playing a game, Dad.
Okay, maybe this isn't the right game to be playing now.
Why not? I'm really good at it.
Let's play another round of Skee-Ball - No, Dad, fuck that.
- Alex.
[GAME GUNFIRE ECHOES] - Give me this thing.
That's enough.
- Fuck, no.
Fuck, no! - All right, buddy, I'm sorry.
Come here.
- Fucking let me go! I'm broken, okay? I'm fucking broken.
That's how it's gonna be.
Why don't you just live with it? - Alex, you're not broken.
- How the fuck would you know? I've seen you twice since I got out of the hospital.
- I had school.
- I had fucking school, too! And I had friends.
Now I don't have anything, except all of you standing around feeling sorry for me, not fucking knowing what to say.
Maybe it would've been better if it'd worked.
Put the bullet through my brain - the way it was supposed to go? - Stop.
Wouldn't that be better? You could get on with your stupid fucking lives.
Fuck you, Alex.
Okay? Shut up.
Just shut up.
- Jess.
- No.
Listen to me, you asshole.
How could you do what you did? After Hannah, I needed you.
You were the only one I could trust, who understood what I was going through, and you were gonna fucking leave me behind? - That's messed up, Alex.
It's messed up.
- I'm sorry.
Everybody here loves you.
And you just don't care? I do care.
I care.
I'm sorry.
[DEPUTY STANDALL] It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
[LAPTOP RINGING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] - Hey.
- Hey.
- How was the party? - Stupid party, stupid people.
[LAUGHS] Sounds right.
Why are you sitting in the dark? I'm introducing my old man to the wizarding world of Harry Potter.
- Seriously? - Seriously.
He's the last person in the world that doesn't know what his Patronus is.
- Fucking muggles.
- Right? Hey.
Pay attention here.
You're gonna need to know that for the sixth movie.
Hey, so, uh I wanna do Zach next.
Okay.
Again? Yeah.
He's just a fucking asshole who needs to be checked.
- Cool.
- Yeah.
So I have this whole idea for him.
- So I'm thinking - Ty, you know I'm down for whatever, but I got to make sure my dad doesn't fall asleep.
He's, like, 47.
They tend to do that during movies.
Hey.
Just tell me the plan.
I'll be there.
Yeah, fine.
Later.
[SIGHS] [SONYA] Clay, isn't it true that you heard Hannah say that she wanted her life to be over? And isn't it true that you did nothing? You did nothing to help her.
If he had been honest with us about the drugs Did you know they were gonna ask? No, of course not.
I removed myself, Matt.
If I were to interfere with a witness A witness? He's your son.
If I were to interfere in any way, I would be fired.
I could be disbarred, Matt.
Our boy did drugs, we didn't know.
He hid a homeless boy for a week, we didn't know.
I mean, what the fuck, Lainie? - [LAINIE] Trying to help a friend in need.
- Our son is in need.
Yes, Matt, I'm aware.
[CLAY] I can't stop thinking about it, Skye.
They destroyed me.
Ask me why she was depressed.
Why she was destroyed.
Ask me who did that to her.
- [SONYA] No further questions.
- [JUDGE] Jury will disregard.
Witness, stand down.
[CLAY] But did I deserve it? [ALEX] Who ordered the cinnamon rolls? If I put that in my mouth, I will literally puke.
- Are we, like, all in bad moods? - [SHERI] I am.
I just don't even have the energy to care.
[JEFF] No, we're just coming down.
It's normal.
- What's the point, right? - Yeah, exactly.
No, but, like, really, what's the point of anything? That's just the Molly talking.
Her name's Hannah.
You've gotta handle the lows if you wanna chase the highs.
Come on, drink some water.
Don't let your mind go to that dark place.
Do you ever think, "I can't do it anymore"? Like, "I wanna die"? Yep.
Every single minute.
Like everything's black? [JEFF] Guys, get through this.
Okay? Get through this moment.
And it'll all be clear.
[CLAY] Skye, she said it and I heard it.
I couldn't help her then, and I couldn't help her today.
I've got to be able to do something to help.
People need to know the whole story.
Hey.
That's great.
[SCOFFS] That's just perfect.
Clay, honey.
Come on, lover.
Give me a little.
I had a shitty day.
Yeah, I know.
I heard Alex had one of his outbursts.
Well, the kid's sick.
I feel bad for him.
Now forget about that.
Babe, I thought we were watching a movie tonight.
- I've seen it.
- But you chose it.
Yeah, so I don't have to pay close attention.
I'd rather pay attention to you.
[CHUCKLES] - Ow.
Careful.
- Yeah.
[SIGHS] Is that better? - Babe, what is up with you tonight? - Just the usual.
Being into you.
[BRYCE GRUNTS] Babe, what what about the movie? Fuck the movie.
[GRUNTING] [SIGHS] Look - You're good, yeah? - [PANTING] - Yeah.
- And you want to, right? Right.
- [SIGHS] - [BRYCE GRUNTING] [GASPING] [GRUNTING] [WHIMPERS, GASPS] - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - [LAINIE] Clay? You can keep up the silent treatment as long as you have to.
I understand.
But Justin will need your support tomorrow.
And on Monday, okay? [SIGHS] You're reading the comments.
Don't ever read the comments.
The shit that people say, about you, about me.
They don't know the whole story.
- Don't do this.
- I'm doing it for you.
- I'm trying to make things right.
- You know it won't.
[SIGHS] What else can I do? You can help Jessica and Justin.
You can figure out those pictures.
I don't care about the fucking pictures.
I care about the truth.
I care about you.
Then don't do it.
You know I don't want you to.
Well, maybe you don't get a say anymore.
People did terrible things to you and they're getting away with it.
- You left those tapes for a reason.
- What reason? To make people face what they did and admit it and understand how fucked up it was.
Do you think I wanted revenge? I don't know what you wanted, because you left a huge fucking mess.
I'm the only one interested in cleaning it up.
It wasn't revenge.
I had to tell my own story.
I wanted people to know what happened so maybe it wouldn't happen again.
- Exactly.
So everyone should hear it.
- No, not like this.
You don't get to decide.
You left.

Seeing Hannah like that, it was surreal.
The only thing that can bring a grown man to his knees.
I felt privileged.
Privileged that this fragile, little thing would trust me before she knew to trust anything else.
And that I'd get to spend the rest of my life getting to know her.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
Don't be.
It's perfectly fine to be emotional up there today.
God.
I remember he couldn't stop crying that day.
He cried more than I did.
You were so strong, I think the nurses were more concerned about me.
You were scared.
We both were.
Turns out we were right to be.
No, no, don't do that to yourself.
Andy, you were an amazing father from day one.
Look, it's natural to ask yourselves these questions.
But what the jury needs to hear today is how much you loved Hannah, and how much trust you placed in Liberty High School to protect her.
Well, there's lots of chatter online about Hannah's tapes.
People are worried it's going to affect the trial.
I'm not concerned.
It still doesn't serve the school to admit them into evidence any more than it does us.
But couldn't it work in our favor? To have Hannah's story out there in her own words? Or will it bias the jury against us? How? How could it do that? To hear what happened to her.
It's a complicated story, Liv.
Ho.
Today is gonna suck.
What, you mean, because of? It's like the first day of school or something.
But, like, in some weird, alternate universe where, like, everyone's been talking about me for months.
Uh, yeah, that's surreal.
Hannah was the kind of person that made you want to be better.
The kind of person who left an impression on everyone she met.
Listen, this is weird, right? Um Yeah.
This is about me, isn't it? Yeah, must be.
Can't believe he'd show up here.
Helmet.
Hate to say I told you so, but Or did we just not think this part through? I'm curious, what happens to Jessica now? Or Alex, or Justin, or you? Clay, did you not get any of my texts? My ringer must be off.
Skye? Hey, hello? Hey, Justin.
I'd say welcome back, but kind of shitty timing.
- What do you mean? - I mean about the tapes.
What about the tapes? Did Clay not tell you? Maybe he doesn't even know.
- Know about what? - They're out.
Someone posted them online.
Everyone listened all last night.
- What? - Yes.
Are you fucking serious? Jensen, did you know about this? I, um Yeah.
I kind of, I guess I knew, but - Look, I gotta go.
- But Jensen.
Hey, Clay! The fuck are you going? We're having a meeting, by the way.
She always saw the best in people, even if they couldn't see it themselves.
But when she walked through those doors at Liberty High, that's not the girl they made her out to be.
My future is at stake here.
What if Harvard finds out? What happened between you and Hannah shouldn't keep you out of Harvard, Marcus.
You don't know that.
This could blow up my entire life! We'll figure out a strategy when we meet.
Everyone's confirmed.
Except I didn't tell Jessica.
I didn't know what to say to her.
Tell her that there's somebody out here trying to fuck up our lives.
When people looked at Hannah, they saw what they wanted to see.
They made assumptions.
They spread rumors.
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey.
The hell is wrong with everyone today? - Shit.
You haven't heard? - Heard what? Maybe we should get out of here.
You want to skip school? Why? What's going on? - Tell me.
- The tapes.
They're out.
What? Oh, my God.
I know.
I'm so sorry.
This is it's so fucked up.
When I think of her walking the halls with those kids - Yeah, the ribbon-cutting.
- Those eyes on her So, with a giant pair of scissors and all that? How the fuck else do you cut ribbon, Scotty? What? I don't know.
I've never been to something like this.
Not that big a deal.
But bring your appetites.
My dad promised food trucks.
- Oh, hell, yes.
- Cool.
Hey, you're coming today, right? What? Yeah, no.
Totally.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Hey! Who did this? - Get the fuck back here! - Hey, relax.
It's fine.
It'll come off.
- Just a stupid fucking prank, right? - Dude, that's pretty fucked up.
- Should we do something? - What would we do? - It's messed up.
- I'm not worried about it.
You wanna call it rape, call it rape.
She wanted me.
Me.
She was practically begging me to fuck her.
If that's rape, then every girl at school Where the fuck did you get that? What the hell was that? - Was that you? - Yeah, it was me.
What do you want us to do? Want me to go after them? How the fuck did this happen? Someone posted the tapes online.
Last night.
Someone? - Anonymously.
- That's fucked up.
What are you gonna do? Um Uh, I, uh I just I need to think for a minute.
I should call my dad.
Get off! Fucking let go! I knew you were a fucking pervert! Hey! Hey! Hey, you fucking assholes! Come on! But even if Hannah couldn't trust her classmates, she should have been able to trust the school itself, especially since we'd chosen Liberty specifically because of their emphasis on safety and support.
So when you enrolled Hannah at the school, did you ask about their policies regarding bullying? Explicitly.
We let them know that Hannah had some problems at her previous school.
Girls being mean, that sort of thing, and we didn't want her to have to go through that again.
And when you asked about those policies, what were you told? They said they had a zero-tolerance policy, that they took that kind of thing extremely seriously, and that she was in good hands.
But then they just stood back and let everything happen.
If the school had just stepped up and paid attention, then things never would've gone as bad as they did for her.
And she'd still be that same happy, hopeful kid she always was.
I know.
Did you hear what he said on the last tape? Okay, but how could she be dating him if he really did it? Unless she didn't know.
Chloe.
Hey.
The ribbon-cutting today, I might be late.
- Are you still going? - Yeah.
- Why wouldn't I be? - Okay.
Well, we'll see you later.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Here you are.
I was starting to think you were avoiding me today.
What? No! No, I, uh - Actually, I got locked in.
- I know.
I had to move the chair.
You don't know why.
I kind of do.
Kind of everyone does.
Oh.
Well, I understand if you change your mind about the movies.
I didn't.
You promised me a date.
You're not getting out of it that easily.
Well Well, can't you tell Warren to handle it faster? It's a shit show around here.
I Hey, I gotta go.
I heard your confession.
You feeling okay, brother? - You didn't look so good the other day.
- You're going down, Bryce.
How do you see that happening, exactly? Without you going with me? I will do whatever I have to to make you fucking pay.
I'm not gonna pay for a goddamn thing, Justin.
I've got a legal team working for me around the clock.
I've got state fucking senators that will talk about what a fine citizen I am.
What have you got? A junkie mom and a deadbeat dad? Oh, shit.
Wait, that's right.
You don't even know your dad, do you? You never met the guy.
You're just a white trash piece of shit, Justin.
Nobody's gonna listen to your truth.
Nobody in this world gives a shit about you.
You've got nothing and nobody.
Hey, Jess.
Yeah, I'm just Yeah, I'm at home.
Yeah, I had to split.
My mom called me super early.
She got in a fight with Meth Seth, so Are you okay? I mean, you were pretty out of it last night.
I mean, we both were.
Huh? Uh Yeah, we did.
Do you not? Do you not remember? Shit, yeah, we were both pretty trashed.
Sorry, I mean Yeah, you seemed like you were pretty into it last night.
Oh, we must've just both passed out after.
Yeah, it was a fucking great party.
- You sick fuck! - What the hell? - I will destroy you.
- Hey, back off, man.
- Get the fuck off! - Hey! - You took pictures of my sister? - What? You followed her and took fucking pictures of her? - No.
- Yes.
You took them and put them in my locker.
What the fuck is wrong with you? This isn't me.
I didn't fucking do this.
- It's fucking you, isn't it? - What? You put the rat in my locker, now this? - What do you want from me? - You got a rat in your locker? - Someone's fucking with you, too? - Yeah, you.
- Why, because of fucking last night? - No, that's not Fuck, it's got to be Bryce.
It's fucking Bryce.
He's trying to keep us quiet, okay? It happened to me, too.
It's not me, I swear.
Zach.
You come near my sister and I'll murder you, you hear me? So, what do you want, an eighth? - I got a really great hybrid right now.
- No, no, I need something stronger.
You got any Oxy? Shit, man.
I can get you Oxy.
It's bucks, dude.
- They got the supply choked off.
- Okay, what can I get right now? I need to get really fucking high, and I've got 20 bucks.
I got some H.
If you really wanna get blind, you got to shoot it.
I - I mean, I don't got works or anything.
- I can hook you up.
Mr.
Baker, you're currently dating someone by the name of Valerie Hampton, is that correct? Yes, my wife and I we're separated.
Is it not true that you first began dating Ms.
Hampton in April of last year? Prior to Hannah's death and prior to your separation? It's not something I'm proud of, but, yes, we saw each other for about a month, then I ended it.
Uh, we didn't reconnect until after Hannah's death, after my separation.
But if Hannah was alive when you first started dating Ms.
Hampton, isn't it possible she knew about the affair? Objection, speculation.
Your Honor, it's necessary to establish a timeline so that we can take into account all possible effects on Hannah's mental state.
Overruled.
Proceed.
Mr.
Baker, is it not possible that Hannah knew, given the timeline? Regardless of whether the two of you ever discussed it.
Unless you You did discuss it.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll call you when I can.
Hannah? - How could you do that? - I love your mother.
I love her with all my heart, I swear to you.
But a marriage, honey Honey, a marriage is a complicated thing.
It's a terrible moment when you realize that your, your parents aren't perfect.
Don't try and turn this into a life lesson for me.
I'm-I'm I'm sorry.
Look, I'll end it.
I'll end it tonight.
And you'll tell Mom, okay? Or I will.
I told my wife about Valerie immediately.
We dealt with it, and afterwards, it wasn't a problem anymore.
Hannah knew that.
She also knew that you had cheated on her mother and she committed suicide less than six months afterward.
No, we moved forward as a family Thank you, Mr.
Baker.
No further questions.
No, her problems were with the school.
With us, she was always a happy girl, she was hopeful.
- She was upbeat - The witness can stand down.
Why can't we explain what actually happened? - Why can't we make a statement? - It's not the time.
When is the time? Everyone knows what she had to say about it.
You wouldn't want it to sound like you were attacking this girl to the press.
I just don't want people to think I'm hiding from this.
- I want them to hear my side.
- They will as soon as you testify.
In the meantime, just block out the noise.
Now, let's try and enjoy this damn thing, shall we? We got a lot of eyes on us today.
You have some fans, dear.
This other girl, are we worried about her? - The girlfriend? No, she seems harmless.
- No, not that Chloe.
She's a trifle.
The girl on the tape.
At the party? We don't even know if there was anyone at any party.
It's just a story.
Is that the position you're taking, or something you truly believe? These kids, Nora they want what Bryce has.
You don't think your son could do these kinds of things? Of course not.
Jesus, do you? I know the boy we raised.
Are you sure? - Excuse me, Mr.
and Mrs.
Walker? - Hi.
What do you have to say for yourself? And your son? Excuse us.
Everybody knows what he did to Hannah Baker.
How can you let him be celebrated like this? We have everything well contained.
You should be ashamed of yourself, Mr.
Bolan.
The school is at fault.
The school.
These are children in their care.
If they know something is wrong, they should take action.
Zach.
Hey.
Did anything Did anything happen to you at school today? Like what? The field looks great.
And the news is here.
What an occasion! We're not staying.
Why not? Do you know why the news vans are here? Do you know about the tapes? I know that she didn't say anything about you that you hadn't already said - That's not it, Mom.
- And at a time like this, your friend Bryce needs you to stand by him.
Let's go, May.
Zachary Dempsey, if you are not here, what are people gonna say? These kids are going through so much.
And parents don't know.
Good afternoon.
I'm Marcus Cole, student body president.
Happy to be here.
Happy to be here today.
Since 1913, Liberty High has been committed to helping students achieve academic excellence in a safe, supportive environment.
But in recent years, our values have gone to shit.
I'm part of the problem.
I lead a group called EnGUYtened, which is supposed to be for enlightened guys.
But today, I'm officially resigning from that group.
Because I'm a hypocrite.
How can I say that I care about protecting girls when I've been protecting a rapist like Bryce Walker? Bryce Walker should pay for what he's done! Hannah Baker was a victim of Bryce Walker.
Liberty needs to change the culture of their school.
Okay, okay.
All right.
Uh It does not protect a child.
Well, our students are playing some sort of prank.
We must protect children like Hannah Baker.
One that's in poor taste, obviously.
But let's move ahead with our program.
What the hell is going on at this school? The young man clearly felt burdened by something.
He needed to make a confession.
It's blackmail.
Someone's got something on him.
We are so thrilled to be he Excuse me.
Can we have some quiet, please? Thank you.
We're thrilled to be here.
- Would you please join me - You know this is all bullshit, right? - It's all lies.
- Yeah, of course, I know.
The parents of our team captain, Bryce Walker.
I can't believe he actually fucking did it.
We're like the fucking puppet masters of the school.
We can get anyone to do anything.
All right.
- Mmm! Nice.
You're getting good.
- Well, success builds confidence.
Pranking the president pulling the ladies.
And by ladies, I mean my sister.
Kenzie told me you guys are going on a little date this weekend.
I was gonna tell you about it, you know.
I just, I don't want it to be weird.
I just wanna No, it's all good.
I mean, I trust you.
As long as you're not actually some crazy stalker who follows girls around with a camera.
Holy shit! Shit.
Hey! Yo, dude.
Dude, come look at this.
Did you hit it? Shit.
Dude.
Look at it, it was like It was, like, flying, like, 30 seconds ago, and now it's just I mean Parents don't know what happens at school.
Damn it, Clay, pick up the phone.
Do you have any idea what you fucking did? And where the hell are you right now? What the fuck did you just do? Hey! Look, I came to you for help and you didn't do shit, man! They're blackmailing me.
They made me say that! - Who the fuck is "they"? - I don't know! How do I know? Look, if that video gets out, man, it's out forever, okay? And I still have a future.
But for you, the tapes are out.
I didn't say anything that hasn't been said already.
Big mistake.
Big fucking mistake.
There are limits to what we can do to help another person, no matter how much we wish there weren't.
We need to take these tapes to the police.
We need to get these boys that did this to her.
Noelle, I don't care what she wants.
She's here.
I'll call you back.
Yes, I promise.
I'll call.
Love you.
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, baby girl.
Let's talk.
- Look, I don't want to talk.
- Honey.
Your mom and I wanna be there for you.
- Whatever you need.
- I'm fine.
I just I have a lot of homework, okay? Mrs.
Baker called for you a little while ago.
What did she want? To check in on you, see how you're doing.
I just I need to be alone, okay? So there's a limit to what we can do to protect them.
And there are some things you just can't protect them from.
I couldn't be there every time someone judged her or shamed her.
I didn't always have the answers.
I didn't always know all the right things to say.
After everything that happened at Liberty High Well, I think it was just too much for Hannah.
After all that, it was just too much.
And did anyone at Liberty inform you of the issues happening on campus? The Hot or Not List being circulated, the suicidal poem being read aloud, the anonymous question, specifically about suicide? No.
No, they never I mean, had they sent out some kind of notification to all the parents, we could have talked to Hannah, we could have started a conversation, but they never informed us about any of it.
So the administration was either ignorant of the problems under their own roof, or they were aware and did nothing? Exactly.
Thank you, Mrs.
Baker.
Mrs.
Baker, were you aware that Hannah knew about - your husband's affair? - I No, I was not aware, but I You never picked up on any signs from her that she may have known or might have been in distress? - Hey, Mom.
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Are you okay? - Oh, yeah.
Your father and I just had a little argument, that's all.
Nothing serious.
- How was school? - School was school.
But here, I, um, got you something.
Irises? They're my favorite.
What's the occasion? Nothing, I just saw them in the window on my way home - and remembered how much you like irises.
- Aww.
I know I never give you anything unless it's, like, Mother's Day or something, but I just wanted to say thank you for being a great mother every day.
Hannah, honey You're so thoughtful.
No, I never noticed anything.
So, even you didn't notice the signs that Hannah was in distress, and yet you expect the school to have done so? - Objection.
Argumentative.
- Withdrawn.
Mrs.
Baker, you say that you didn't notice whether Hannah was in distress.
But is there anything in your family history to suggest that Hannah may have had a predisposition to any mental health problems? There have been some issues with anxiety on my side of the family, but nothing serious, and Hannah never showed any signs.
And were any of these issues ever serious enough to require treatment? Well, yes, I've seen a therapist on and off over the years during stressful periods So you've received treatment from a mental health care professional, but you never thought that your daughter might require similar care? She was just a child and, again, she never showed any signs.
Did you or did you not take Hannah to see a therapist, Mrs.
Baker? No, I never did.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You made it.
Yeah, I did.
- Hi.
- Hi.
It's so good to see you.
You look great.
For a person in a mental health facility? No.
No, just for a person in the world who always looks great.
Stop.
I'm kidding.
And thank you.
I was, um, really glad you called back.
Oh, I just got my phone privileges.
I haven't been dodging you.
Wait, so you just got all those messages at once? - I hope you skipped some.
- I listened to every one.
Okay, guys, we're starting yoga in here in a few minutes for whoever's interested and who won't be making fun of the poses.
Then we've got our small group sessions.
Bring your share journals or pay the price.
Cool.
This, uh - This place seems really nice.
- Come on, I'll give you the VIP tour.
Like, everyone's brain chemistry is different, so it might take them a few tries before they can find the right combination of meds.
Wait, is this too much right now? No, no, no.
It's just Look, are they sure it's bipolar? It feels like kind of a blurry line between someone being manic and also just, you know, being in a really good mood.
Clay, I tried to jerk you off in front of your parents.
I mean, that wasn't just a "good mood.
" Yeah.
Yeah, point taken.
That was pretty fucked up.
But the meds and everything What if that all, like, changes you? I hope it does.
Look, the person that I was, it wasn't really working for me.
Like, the good moods, they could be amazing, but I was like dancing on the edge of a really high cliff and the fall was just really fucking hard and far.
- I'm sorry.
- Wait.
You know it's not your fault, right? No, I I know.
I don't know if you do.
All this time - How could you keep that from me? - I'm sorry, Olivia.
I thought I fixed it.
I didn't wanna make things worse for you or Hannah.
- I just wanted to move on.
- Clearly.
I didn't know how to talk to you anymore.
I didn't know how to tell you that I needed to feel loved and held, and I needed to be needed.
Oh.
- Oh, so this is my fault? - It's not your fault.
I'm not blaming you, I'm blaming us.
We should have communicated.
We should have noticed that our baby girl was suffering.
We should have done something.
Don't you dare, okay? Don't you dare make me feel like I failed my daughter.
Okay? If we lose this trial, it's your fault.
If we win this trial, it's my fault.
How can you not see that? How can you not feel that sitting on that stand? That's all it took? This lawyer gets in your head, and suddenly we're on trial? I never wanted to go to trial.
I never wanted to, but deep down, I thought we had a case.
I believed that the school, the bullies, that monster were responsible for our losing Hannah, but we're in this, too, Liv.
We're part of it too, Liv.
And if you can't see that now, I don't think you ever will.
I don't want to fight anymore.
I don't wanna fight.
I don't wanna fight with you and not in this courtroom.
I think this case is better off without me.
And so are you.
So, when do you come home? The thing is, my mom doesn't want me to go back to Liberty.
She wants me to transfer schools.
Like East County? Like another state.
I'm going to live with my aunt and uncle.
Wait, you You're never coming back? - I need to hit the reset button.
- The reset button.
- To delete everything that came before? - No, not what I mean.
Not delete, not you, not our friendship, but I need to move on.
- They're making you do that? - No.
I'm doing it.
I can't keep pretending like I'm okay, like I don't need to work to get well, like it's everyone's fault but mine.
I wanna live a better life than that.
- You're gonna forget me.
- Oh, my God, I never could.
I'm just gonna be this one guy you knew one time.
I can let you go and still love you.
I'll always love you.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
You're a good person, Clay.
And you can help people.
Just maybe not how you think they need to be helped.
Clay? Clay! Hey, I need to talk to you.
Clay, why aren't you answering your phone? Justin.
Hey, dickhead, where's Clay? Justin, I said Justin.
Fuck.
Justin! Hey, wake up.
Wake the fuck up! Hey, wake up.
Justin! Roll over! Come on, Justin.
I can't roll you! Fuck! Fuck! I won't fucking let you die.
Fuck! Oh, fuck.
Hey.
We don't always get second chances to help people.
To be there in the right way.
To love them.
Hi.
My dad said you called.
And I heard what happened in court today and I don't know, I just wanted to reach out, you know, to see if there's anything I could do.
Come in.
I think it's a tolerance thing.
I don't know.
- I've only ever shot up a couple times.
- You could've fucking died.
Like anyone would even care at this point.
Dude, don't joke about that.
Shit.
Sorry.
Hey, hey.
Drink this.
Where's the scar? Oh, it's There's scars.
But they're under my hair.
That's why I grew it out.
Yeah, I remember how it used to be.
When you first started at Liberty, some of the guys were like, "That hair makes him a fag.
" But I was like, "That's fucking stupid.
" Well, that's super kind of you.
Yeah, well Whatever.
You're still in love with Jessica, aren't you? It doesn't matter.
Look at you.
It clearly does.
What the hell happened? He shot up and then he almost choked on his own puke.
What the fuck is wrong with you, Justin? You were just clean Leave him alone, okay? What? Now you're defending him? Yeah, what the hell were you thinking with the tapes, Clay? You have any idea what you did to Jessica? Yeah, I was trying to get justice for Hannah.
And I'm sorry if it hurt Jessica, but maybe it's time for her truth to come out, too.
What the fuck gives you the right to decide what needs to come out? Look, I've done everything I can, everything I can think of to make things right.
But I can't do it alone.
Okay? Look, I'm sorry about the tapes.
But it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
And I need you guys.
Turn your hands.
There you go, good hit.
Yeah.
Wow! - You did need to come in.
- Yeah.
I feel better already.
Ah.
Well, the night is young.
It could get even better.
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
What you got in mind? Oh! Hey! Hey, I didn't know you were coming in today.
Lucas, this is Tony.
Tony, this is Lucas.
Oh, hey, man.
Good to meet you.
Yeah, man.
It's good to meet you, too.
I'll talk to you later.
I should get out of here anyway.
I'm pretty tired.
Hey.
Have we trained together before? No, I don't, uh, I don't think so.
Have a good night.
We don't always know everything a kid is going through.
Hey, buddy.
We agreed.
Door open, yeah? - It was open.
- No, it was almost closed.
We agreed 45 degrees open all the time, all right? Then last month, we negotiated down to 30.
It was at three just now, so keep it open, all right? Wait, Dad? I'm really sorry about last night.
I didn't mean to ruin the party.
Oh, buddy.
You didn't.
And I feel like I owe you an apology.
Because I think I've been pushing you too hard.
No, I think maybe it's a good thing.
Because today I, like, I really pushed myself and it kind of turned out okay.
- That's great.
- Yeah, and my memory's getting better.
Good, well, the doctor didn't say you were stuck, right? He said that your recovery would be unpredictable, but there's always hope.
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.
Um, so, last night, with that video game, it actually started making me remember this other one, Desert Duty.
So, I was thinking, um, just maybe if I play that one again, it would actually help me remember more.
- That's a shooter game, Desert Duty? - Yeah, I know, Dad.
But it's not like that.
I just There's something that I gotta remember.
Yeah, buddy, I don't know.
Yeah, no, I know.
I get it.
It was probably stupid anyway.
- I should probably get some sleep.
- All right.
- Night.
- Night.
But, kids, they don't always tell you everything they're feeling.
"I'm saying that the house is on fire, and all I know how to do is write poems.
All I know how to do is arrange flowers on the table of a burning home.
I am pressing against the frame.
I am chanting the right words.
I am gripping my fists and letting them go.
" Wow.
Hannah wrote that? I must have read it a million times.
The whole time, I thought it was about that school.
The suffocating, oh, my God, it's right there in front of me.
The burning home, the flowers It was about her dad's affair.
There she was, trying to comfort me, when I should've been trying to comfort her.
I mean, why didn't I see it? Olivia, you can't blame yourself.
This is Andy's fault.
Jackie, please don't tell me how to feel right now.
- I'm sorry.
- You're right.
No, I'm sorry.
It just It's more complicated than that.
I didn't mean to overstep.
You know, I think maybe I should head to bed.
- No, no, no.
- No, it's been a long day.
Really, I need to get some rest.
It was nice meeting you, Jessica.
Well You must think I'm an idiot, wanting to protect a man who doesn't deserve it.
I get it.
I mean, I really get it.
You love him, right? Despite everything, and it's crazy, but you love him.
I do.
Even though he hurt you so bad.
You know, Jessica, if there's If there's anything you ever wanna talk about Sometimes I think if Hannah would have come to me, maybe things would have been different.
Maybe it was too painful for her to talk about it.
Maybe she kept it all in to protect herself.
I'm not good at that.
The more I think about it, she was really brave.
Oh, but, honey, we both know that didn't work.
Keeping it in, that's not brave.
Feeling the pain, facing it that takes courage.
It's okay to let it out.
It's okay.
Not a day passes during this trial It's okay.
In the months it took to get here that I don't wish I could have wrapped my arms around her and told her it would be okay.
But I never had that chance.
Why didn't you tell us he was on drugs? He was getting better, okay? Anyway, I didn't even know about the drugs when I first brought him here.
- Should we call social services? - No.
Dad! Call social services, he disappears into the system, he doesn't testify.
Jesus, is that what we care about? No, I care about keeping the kids safe, which is hard to do when they're both fighting us.
- How am I fighting you? - The Register called me today, Clay.
Those audio files were watermarked.
You stole them from my computer.
You told me you weren't working on the case.
- That's no excuse.
- You told Sonya.
About Zach texting Hannah.
That's how they knew everything.
Is that true? She's a colleague.
I pointed her in a direction.
- It's hardly the same thing.
- It's worse.
You endangered my job, my license, our livelihood.
You ruined my fucking life! Jesus, you sound like children.
And there's just one child here.
- What is that supposed to mean? - Clay needs us to be his parents now.
- I don't need anything from you guys.
- Clay, go to your room.
What? - How is that fair? - Go to your goddamn room! Now! Enough is enough.
This family will not be destroyed.
Not for any case, not for any other parents' kid, not by drugs.
We will not let this happen.
I get it, you're mad.
I'm mad at him, too, but he is a child! How can you fix something if you don't know what's broken? Hannah didn't tell us.
Clay.
No.
You don't talk.
You don't get to say anything.
This is your fucking fault, Hannah.
This mess started with you.
I put out the tapes, and that was stupid, but you made them.
- You fucked up people's lives! - I know.
- I'm sorry.
- Are you? Are you sorry? That doesn't do a fucking bit of good because you are gone! You killed yourself and you didn't fucking care.
- I did! - No, or you never would've done it.
I was hurting, and I didn't think about who I might hurt.
You did an evil thing.
Get the fuck out.

1 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] My name is Kevin Porter.
I'm a guidance counselor at Liberty High School.
I would say I help as many kids as I can.
That's why I got into education.
But I don't get to see every kid.
I try to keep an eye out, but you have to count on kids to come to you.
And not every kid who does come to you is able to ask for the help they need.
Not every kid tells you the whole truth.
[HANNAH ON RECORDING] We all need it.
Human contact.
And communications class, crazy as it was, was human contact for me.
Until someone in that class cut my lifeline.
Someone who was known for being sweet.
I'll tell you who it is, but you're going to have to wait.
- Just like I did.
- Hey.
[MRS.
BRADLEY] Oh! Kevin.
Uh, what are you doing here on a Sunday? I should be asking you the same question.
I thought I'd have the place to myself.
Well, they bumped me up.
I testify first thing in the morning.
Wow.
Me, too.
So, I guess I go after you? Oh.
So, what's this about? I couldn't listen when they first came out.
But now I just can't stop listening.
Ah.
- So you're here preparing? - Yeah.
Isn't that why you're here? I sat down, you know, with the lawyers.
I know what to say.
We followed protocol.
We did all we could for Hannah with the information that we had.
I sat down with them, too, and I feel like it's true.
Well but the world is not listening to a recording of your class.
They're not gonna play the tape in court, though.
That's what the lawyers say.
But they know what's on it, and they know what happened.
But you know what was in your heart.
She couldn't tell you what she needed.
You did your best.
Did I? [STUDENTS CHATTERING] [KEVIN] Not every kid who comes to you in pain can tell you where it hurts.
[HANNAH] I need it to stop.
[KEVIN] You need what to stop? [HANNAH CRYING] I need everything to stop.
Just, people, life.
What did you mean when you said you needed life to stop? I don't know.
'Cause that seems like a very serious thing to say.
I know.
I I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
[KEVIN] She said she didn't mean it.
I made the mistake of believing her.
Hannah told me she was struggling, but she didn't specifically mention suicide.
[HANNAH] I just need everything to stop.
What do you need to stop, Hannah? Do I really need to spell it out for you? I'm thinking about killing myself.
[KEVIN] If she had said those words, of course I would have taken action.
Did you have an encounter at the party? An encounter? Yeah.
You could say that.
Did he force himself on you? I think so.
You think so, but you're not sure? Did you tell him to stop? No.
Did you tell him "no"? No.
Maybe you consented, then changed your mind.
No, it's not like that.
Should we involve your parents or the police? No! Hannah, who's the boy? [PHONE RINGS] [KEVIN] I think we all wish it could have gone differently.
What happened, Hannah? I got into a hot tub with Bryce Walker and then he raped me.
[KEVIN] We can have the best intentions and still fall short.
No Justin this morning? He's usually the first one up.
He's not our problem anymore.
What does that mean, he's not our problem? It means he's gone.
He took off.
- Did you try calling him? - He doesn't have a phone.
Your mother gave him one on the family plan.
[SCOFFS] - Of course she did.
- Well, we should call him.
I don't know his number.
I imagine the phone company will have it.
Jesus, why do you care? He had a bed, he had food, he had new clothes, and a new phone, apparently, and he didn't want any of it.
- So why don't we just let him go? - Clay, what's this about? He's scheduled to testify on Monday, and that was so important to you, you smuggled him in here.
Where's Mom? Your mother and I had a disagreement last night.
Yeah, I was there.
And she's staying with her sister for a few days.
Why? Oh, just to give us both time to figure things out.
The past few weeks have been stressful around here for all of us.
Let's move.
Start over somewhere, just you and me.
Clay, it's It's not permanent.
- Your mom and I are just cooling off.
- I don't care.
I don't ever wanna go to that school again.
Look, everybody hates me there.
Someone online called me a murderer because I was on Hannah's tapes.
- Why do you read what people say online? - [PHONE BUZZES] Let's move.
- Anywhere.
- Clay.
This is our home.
All right? This is our family.
We've made a bit of a mess.
But nothing's broken we can't fix.
Everything's broken.
And I don't think any of it can be fixed.
[KEVIN] Some kids can't speak their truth.
Some won't.
To us, to their families We can go ahead and eat.
It's Sunday morning.
There's no hurry.
We'll wait for our guest.
[BRYCE] She said 10:00 was fine, so I don't know what's going on.
[NORA] Was this before or after the ribbon cutting ceremony? I mean, I invited her yesterday at school.
And did she confirm? She might not know to confirm.
Not everyone has a grandmother like yours, wielding Emily Post like a bible.
- She knows things like that.
- Well, then, I wonder what's keeping her.
Did the two of you discuss the ceremony at all? No, ChlÃe doesn't care about that stuff.
[SIGHS] I'll just I'm gonna try her again.
[BARRY] What are you doing? - I don't know what you mean.
- You know exactly what I mean.
Leave the boy alone.
Can you honestly say you recognize the person on that tape? Have you ever said anything even remotely resembling the filth that came out of his mouth? It was a setup.
He was drunk.
That was not our son talking.
You're his mother, for Christ's sake.
You raised him.
[BRYCE] She's still not picking up.
Let's just eat, I guess.
Marisa? If you would, please.
Son, if something's not right with ChlÃe, you need to make it right.
Do you understand? Yeah, Dad.
A woman who loves you is to be respected and not to be crossed.
[KEVIN] And some kids have secrets they believe they have to keep for their own survival.
[CALEB] You can't hide in this town with that car.
- Hey.
- Hey? That's what I get? You're sitting when you should be boxing.
I can't always find someone to fill a Saturday session last-minute.
Yeah, I'm sorry, okay? There's a lot going on.
Yeah.
Yeah, clearly.
You wanna tell me about Lucas? - Who? - Lucas.
You met him last night, you got weird, and then you bailed.
Then this morning, you didn't show up.
It's got nothing to do with Lucas, okay? It's the trial.
And now these tapes.
Yeah, that's some shit.
And I've never lost a friend like that, but if you wanna talk about it I'm not going to be right until after I testify.
And I shouldn't have left you hanging.
I didn't want to make my drama yours.
And I'm sorry.
Now, was that so hard? - Oh, fuck you.
Yes, actually.
Yes.
- [CALEB LAUGHING] Wanna take your mind off it all and watch Madrid destroy Barcelona Monday night? What makes you think I like soccer? You're Mexican and you're gay.
How could you not like soccer? Yeah, okay.
It's a date.
[SOFT ROCK SONG PLAYS] [CHUCKLES] [KEVIN] And we may think we know what they're going through, but each kid goes through it in their own way.
Hi.
Um, can I please have a large Coke and a medium popcorn, uh, with butter only on half? But not the bottom half.
Like, fill it up normally and then carefully put butter only on the left half.
[STAMMERING] It's very important.
Just half.
I'll have the same thing, please.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER ON FILM] So I came back home To get cleaned And to clear my head But there was still a chill In my bones Even in the ground below It started shaking Oh, I can't change What already happened I can only control how I react I don't know, for all I know Maybe, maybe Yeah, it already happened again Sometimes I wonder If you're better off Sometimes I wonder If you're better off Sometimes I wonder If you're better off Without me [TYLER BREATHING HEAVILY] [TYLER GROANING] What's wrong? - Sorry, bathroom.
- Wait, Tyler.
Sometimes I wonder If you're better off [TYLER WHISPERS] Oh, fuck! Oh, shit.
[KEVIN] And so they think they're the only person in the world feeling what they're feeling, and that no one could possibly understand.
[KEEP CASE OPENS] [GAME CHIMES] [BUTTON CLICKS] - [MAN] Advance! - [EXPLOSION] - [MAN SCREAMS] - [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] [MAN 1] On your left! [MAN 2] Go, go! - [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] - [MAN 2 GROANS] Go, go! Reload! - [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] - [MAN 1] Grenade! Move on, move on.
[MAN 2 SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [MEN GROANING] [KEVIN] They think that what's hurting can never be healed.
So they don't tell us.
They hide, they deflect.
They try to become the person they think we want to see.
[DOOR OPENS] - [TV TURNS ON] - Hey, baby.
You want some lunch? Isn't it, like, 10:00? Uh, dinner, then? I can I can make you something.
Yeah, well, there's hardly anything left.
- We ate most of the groceries yesterday.
- [TV TURNS OFF] I forgot how much a growing boy can eat.
Yeah.
There's also only so many actual groceries at 7-Eleven.
Look at you.
You're taller.
I'm not.
I basically shrunk on the streets.
Well, you're still my big, tall, handsome boy.
I missed you.
I missed you, too, Mom.
It's It's nothing.
What'd you get into out there? I never wanted this life for you.
- I know.
- You don't deserve that life.
Nobody does.
Then why are you still with Seth? [SIGHS] Baby He loves me.
[STAMMERING] Come on, okay? We can find a new place.
We We can get the fuck out of here.
I can't, baby, you know that.
And I need you here.
Promise me you'll stay this time.
Yeah, yeah.
I promise.
[KEVIN ON RECORDING] If you don't want to press charges against this boy, if you're not even sure you can press charges, then there really is only one option.
[HANNAH ON RECORDING] What is it? [KEVIN] I'm not trying to be blunt here, Hannah, but you can move on.
[KEVIN] And for many kids, trust doesn't come easy.
Trusting an adult with something so personal I can understand her silence.
Hey, buddy.
Listen, it's been a while since we talked.
I know I beat the shit out of you, and I'm sorry about that, but I got no beef with you, really.
We're not enemies.
So just mind your business and I'll take care of mine, okay? Get your hands off me.
Watch your fucking tone.
And, you know, watch yourself.
I don't know how you got to Marcus, but this shit [MRS.
CHILDS] Mr.
Jensen.
Principal Bolan would like to see you, now.
[KEVIN] I can understand why she couldn't say those words to me.
[DENNIS] Did you attempt to find who had written that? Yes.
I told my students that I was available if they needed to talk.
Were their parents notified? No, I wanted my class to be a safe place where students could share without fear of punishment, so, um, I didn't involve their parents.
That would've broken their trust.
Did you take any action outside of discussion to help this student who was clearly crying out to you for help? Yes, I offered resources, including phone numbers for crisis hotlines.
So you told them to look somewhere else for help, is that right? I made available every resource that I could, including my time.
No further questions.
[SONYA] Mrs.
Bradley, your class submissions are anonymous because that fosters honesty.
- Isn't that correct? - Yes.
Um, I wanted every student to feel comfortable, so I made the submissions anonymous.
And is it fair to say that if you had notified their parents that your students might have stopped making submissions? Yes.
Trust is everything with kids.
They're very hesitant to give it and very quick to take it back.
Was this the only student whose writing suggested emotional distress last semester? No.
It happens a lot.
[SONYA] And isn't it true that you did offer resources to students in need? Yes.
I brought it up every day in class for weeks.
So wouldn't you say it's pretty clear Hannah didn't want to be identified? Objection.
Calls for speculation.
[JUDGE] Sustained.
[SONYA] Hannah chose not to identify herself and accept your offers for additional resources.
- True? - True.
Um, teenagers often don't know what help they need, much less how to ask for it.
[SONYA] No further questions.
[BOLAN] I left a message with your mother about your unexcused absence on Friday.
- My mother doesn't live with us anymore.
- Oh? Hence the absence? - Uh, no.
I took a mental health day.
- Oh, I see.
The same day Hannah Baker's tapes were posted online.
Hmm? Come on.
You're telling me those two things are unrelated? My girlfriend is in a psychiatric hospital.
- I went to visit her.
- Was the visit prearranged? It was with her.
All right, Clay, you know what? I don't have a lot of patience these days.
So let's talk about the real issue here.
You're acting out, and I need to know why.
I need to know what you need because I don't wanna see somebody getting hurt with this.
Somebody already has gotten hurt.
Two people, but we're not allowed to talk about them.
Suicide contagion is a real thing, and we've got to take measures to protect you kids.
I don't understand.
How does silence protect us? Kids get talking about Hannah, maybe even admiring what she did, they might think somehow that this is an answer.
It might be a way for other kids to feel their pain, that they could live on after they die.
Where on her tapes does Hannah say that? Well, whoever posted her tapes online seems to believe exactly that, that her story should go on forever.
Maybe they just wanted to start a conversation.
We weren't talking about these things before Hannah.
Of course we were.
In counseling sessions, in health classes.
That's not talking, that's telling.
Clay [SIGHS] All right.
I know you think that I'm the bad guy in this whole story.
But I've been educating kids for 30 years, and the most important thing to me is keeping you safe, keeping you alive.
I'm alive.
And the most dangerous thing would be to believe somehow that Hannah's suicide is more than a tragic death.
She's not a hero.
She does not have lessons to teach us.
And we need to recognize the sad and simple truth that she is dead and gone forever.
I recognize that.
No, I don't think you really do.
Which is why I'm recommending a schedule change.
You'll be taking Alternative Strategies and Solutions.
- As punishment.
- No.
To help you find ways of coping with what you're feeling.
[PAPER RUSTLES] Have you even listened to them? The tapes? No.
I was made aware of them by Mr.
Porter, but we brought them directly to our attorneys.
I didn't listen to them.
Maybe you should.
[DENNIS] So, after you let her leave your office, what was your follow-up? [KEVIN SIGHS] I didn't let her leave.
She walked out.
I asked her to come back, to sit down, and she didn't.
- How do you keep your appointments? - In a schedule book.
Do you recognize this book? Yes.
It's mine.
Submitted as exhibit 17, Your Honor.
Mr.
Porter, did you log your meeting with Hannah? Uh, yes, I believe so.
But the page corresponding to that date, October 9th, 2017, is missing.
Did you rip that page out of the book? - I did.
- Are you in the habit of ripping pages out of your schedule book? I [SIGHS] Look, there was a lot of confusion going around at that time, after I found out what Hannah had done.
[DENNIS] Mr.
Porter, earlier, you testified that Hannah came to you with an incident, but she wasn't specific.
What did she say about it? She said it happened at a party.
An encounter with a boy.
Did she say anything about the nature of that encounter? She implied that it was intimate.
Was it your impression, based on that conversation, Mr.
Porter, that Hannah Baker had been raped by a student at Liberty High? She never used the word "rape," okay? It was not clear that it was a sexual assault.
But isn't it your job to fill in the gaps? No, my job is to ask questions, and I did.
What was clear was that she was uncomfortable talking to me.
Did you think of referring her to a female counselor? I didn't have a chance to before she left.
So, even if she didn't say the word "rape," knowing what you know now, do you believe Hannah was raped? I didn't necessarily think so at the time, but yes, I believe that she was.
- [DENNIS] By a student at Liberty? - [KEVIN] Yes.
- [DENNIS] And the name of that student? - Objection! Speculation.
Your Honor, the witness already testified that Hannah never named this alleged attacker.
Your Honor, Mr.
Porter believes Hannah was raped, which means he now believes that Hannah came to his office with a serious problem.
The school's response to that and their failure to discipline the offender is relevant.
- Overruled.
- We'll object again, Your Honor.
It's a violation of FERPA for this student to be named.
[DENNIS] The witness didn't come by this information - in a confidential setting.
- [JUDGE] I'll allow the question.
- [SONYA] Your Honor - [JUDGE] I'll allow it.
[DENNIS] Mr.
Porter, do you know the name of the student that raped Hannah Baker? I have since come to learn that his name is Bryce Walker.
[GAVEL BANGING] Hey.
I've been looking for you.
[CHLÃE] Sorry I didn't call you back this weekend.
I had to babysit my sister, and my mom was working, and ChlÃe, look, I know we talked a little bit on Friday about how Hannah made all that stuff up.
"Every girl at this school wants to be raped"? Bryce, what does that even mean? [SIGHS] It was just It was me talking shit.
I was a little drunk and that kid pissed me off.
And people come at you when they're jealous.
You know that.
What about Hannah? Okay.
Um the truth is Hannah and I hooked up.
And it didn't mean anything to me, but she got, like, obsessed.
And she said all that stuff to get back at me.
Why didn't you tell me any of this before? I'm sorry.
I know, I should have.
I I didn't wanna talk shit about a dead girl.
[CHLÃE SIGHS] You know, I I feel terrible about what happened to her.
And, um Um, you know, I was embarrassed that you might have to hear all that shit.
That you might believe it.
[CHUCKLES] Okay.
You're, um You're just You're really special to me.
And my folks, uh, they missed you on Sunday.
Yeah, I just I had to babysit my sister, so It's cool.
They just wanted to see if you wanted to come to the Amalfi Coast with us this summer.
Wait.
- Oh, my God, are you serious? - Yeah, it'll be fun.
I mean, there's a certain amount of dressing up and having-cocktails-with-adults bullshit that we gotta do, but the rest is just sun and food, beauty.
That's amazing.
Yeah.
[SNIFFLES] I've never even left the country before.
I don't even have a passport.
We'll take care of all that stuff.
So, what do you say? Can the cheer team summer camp spare you for a few weeks? Ah, dude, what are we gonna do Shit, are we, like, interrupting? No, no, it's cool.
We were just making plans for ChlÃe to come to Italy this summer.
Right, babe? Yeah, maybe.
I I have to ask my mom first.
- I'll catch up with you later.
- Okay.
Seriously? Who says "maybe" to a free vacation? Jesus.
Chew your fucking food.
[UNZIPPING BAG] Does no one ever see the red light? - Oh, hey, man.
- Hey.
So, um are you and your parents all good? Mack said you guys had, like, a family emergency.
I had to pick her up from the Crestmont.
Yeah, no.
Uh, everything's totally fine now, yeah.
Mack's a good liar.
You? Not so much.
What the hell, man? - Who bails on someone like that? - No, I know.
It's just, um we're friends, and, uh dating your sister just kind of felt like I was crossing a line.
But I don't I won't ever I never want to disrespect you or Mackenzie.
And I'm just I am sorry I ghosted.
Don't tell me, tell her.
I'm glad we cleared this whole thing up.
Thought you might have become an actual asshole.
Speaking of assholes, what's next for our friend Marcus, huh? - Oh, man, we're done with Marcus.
- What? Why? He got suspended.
I don't think we can top that.
What? Holy shit, that's amazing! People are finally starting to pay attention.
They're starting to see these fucking hypocrites for who they are.
We got Marcus.
We're about to destroy Ryan I figure we start thinking bigger.
[AMBER] So, that's it? That was it all along? You just wanted his money? [BILLS RUSTLE] I'm getting out of here, Mom.
You should, too.
Honey you can run as far as you want, you will never get away from who you are.
That's fine.
Just as long as I can get away from who I was.
[AMBER] He'll kill me.
When he finds out.
Not if he can't find you.
Okay, so, three stops in town for supplies: gas station, Walplex, Ralphie's Pet Store.
Pet store? Dude, trust me.
We're going to wait for dark, take the service road, then we're gonna rush the stuff in, and boom.
- Nice.
- Shit.
Chill.
[TYLER] Hey, Clay.
Hey.
You in the right place? Apparently.
Why? I mean, what are you here for? Truancy, grudges, the hypocrisy of high school administrators.
Dude, we've never officially met, but you helped me fix my bike once freshman year.
Cyrus.
- Clay.
- Dude, I know.
That Bryce Walker thing? That was fucking hard-core, man.
I mean, you have balls.
I mean, we heard you literally getting the shit kicked out of you.
You're coughing up blood.
And you still keep fucking talking to him? I mean, damn.
Uh thanks? No.
Thank you.
So, what do you guys actually do in here? We plot the complete and violent overthrow of civilization.
Super.
Count me in.
[SONYA] Isn't it true that Hannah failed to use words or phrases that indicated to you, with certainty, that a sexual assault had taken place? - Yes.
- [SONYA] And is it not true that she refused to name this alleged attacker? Yes.
And isn't it true, Mr.
Porter, that you listened, inquired, and offered her suggestions to address the concerns she did share? Yes.
Then according to the Liberty High handbook, Hannah didn't give you the information needed to go about the mandatory protocols, correct? Correct.
Therefore, you did everything that was required of you, and the truth is there was nothing more you could have done.
Would you agree? [KEVIN SIGHS] No.
- [SONYA] Let me rephrase that question - I said, no.
I could have done more.
I could have stopped her from walking out that door.
- [SONYA] Nothing further, Your Honor.
- She didn't just leave.
I let her go.
Nothing further, Mr.
Porter.
Thank you.
[DENNIS] I'd like a redirect.
- [PHONE RINGING] - Hey, Hannah, wait.
Hannah, I said stop! Please.
[KEVIN SLAMS RECEIVER] Look, I can't let you walk out that door.
Why? What else is there to say? Listen, what happened to you was not your fault.
You don't know what happened to me.
Hannah, if my daughter were older, I would tell her the same thing.
That men, they can control themselves.
Everybody can.
Everybody acts like consent is this complicated thing, but it's not.
All right? Everybody knows whether they have it or not, and it was that boy's job to know.
Mr.
Porter Listen.
Listen to me.
It wasn't your fault.
We need to get you some help.
What if it's too late? What if I'm too messed up to fix it? No.
It's never too late.
It's never too late.
Just, please, sit down.
[DOOR CLOSES] [HANNAH SIGHS] You have so much life to live.
You have so much.
And you're gonna get You're gonna get through this.
I'm gonna help you.
There are many people out there that wanna help you.
Hannah it's gonna be okay.
But it is too late.
I'm dead.
[SIGHS] Yeah.
But some girl, somewhere, right now she's going through, you know, what you're feeling, and I don't want her to die.
You hear me? [KEVIN CRYING] I was just trying to do the the right thing.
I was following protocol.
[SNIFFLES] The protocol probably needs to change.
But more importantly Kevin Porter needs to change.
[SIGHS, VOICE BREAKS] Mrs.
Baker, I didn't mean to let your daughter down.
I'm sorry.
[CHATTER] [DOOR OPENS] You did the right thing.
I doubt that the school will agree.
But are you right with you? Are you at peace in your own heart? Good Lord, babe, I don't think that I ever will be.
You're a good man, Kevin Porter.
What do you think they're gonna do to me? Nothing they haven't done already.
Nothing that's gonna hurt you more than what you feel right now.
Come on, let's go home.
Yeah.
[CHATTER] [CLAY GRUNTING] [CLAY GROANING] [PANTING, GROANING] [DOOR SLAMS] [DOOR OPENS, SLAMS] [GASPING, GROANS] [GASPING CONTINUES] [ZACH KNOCKS] - [ZACH] Hey.
- Hey.
Are you Um, I mean, what are you listening to? A podcast for English.
- Cool.
- But um, yeah, I've I've heard the tapes.
You know about Mr.
Porter, right? - About what happened in court today? - Yeah.
Are you okay? I'm fine.
I believe Bryce.
I know he's he's got a good heart.
Are you sure that you're okay? With him and everything? Yeah.
Yeah, no, we're good.
You can tell Bryce I believe him.
Cool.
- [POP MUSIC PLAYING] - [BOTH VOCALIZING] - Oh, my God.
- Where you going? Dude, your friends are really cool.
I love that they know nothing about me.
Right? So, is Garrett coming? Uh, no, he had a thing.
Um So, what do you think of Damon? He's been checking you out all afternoon.
And the boy can move.
He's the best hurdler at Washington.
Washington? That's, like, our rival.
Yeah.
And he's cute, right? - Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know.
I mean I don't think I know how to flirt anymore.
There's only one way to find out.
You feel me? [LAUGHS] [DAMON] I gotta admit something.
Every time you've smiled, I forgot where I was 'cause I get so caught up in it.
[BOTH LAUGH] Wow, that's the nicest thing anyone's said to me in a really long time.
Yeah? [OTHERS] Ooh! [CAR HORN HONKS] [HONKING CONTINUES] [STAMMERING] Shit.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
I'll see you later, Nina.
Can I get your number, or? - The hell you doing with that boy? - Dad, relax, please.
How can I? Help me understand, Jessica.
Help me to understand how, after everything, you put yourself out there like that? I don't know, Dad.
I'm just worried about you.
About these new friends of yours, this Nina girl.
Are they the best influence for you? What? Why? Because they're black? Is that a serious question? Have you looked at me lately? [BOTH LAUGHING] Really? Oh, my God.
I don't know, Dad.
[EXHALES] It was like it wasn't me up there.
I thought I was ready, but clearly I'm not.
I just I don't wanna make a big deal out of it.
I'm just trying to figure everything out, okay? Okay.
Okay.
- [ENGINE STARTS] - And can we please not tell Mom? [LAUGHING] Oh - You better believe.
- [BOTH LAUGH] [CYRUS] Dude, what happened to you? [CHATTER] Don't worry about it.
Fuck, man.
You have a way of getting the shit kicked out of you.
Thank you for noticing.
It's about power, man.
What do you mean? The people who have it and the people who don't.
You feel that, right? Me and Tyler, we don't have the power.
We get shit on, pushed around.
Now you're one of us, too.
- You think? - You are.
Dude.
But we're gonna take some of that power back tonight, me and Tyler.
What are you talking about? Don't tell him.
- Tell me what? - We can't trust him.
- We hate the same people.
- That doesn't mean anything.
It does, though.
He's got plenty of reasons to fuck shit up, just like us.
- It's not like we couldn't use the help.
- What are you talking about? [SIGHS] That does look like it hurts, man.
Yeah.
You wanna hit back? [DOOR BELL JINGLES] [ALEX] Hi, Mrs.
Baker.
Alex, hi.
I was, um I was just wondering, is the job still open? Yes.
Of course.
Okay, well, um, I can start right now.
I've just, um I've just had to do some things lately, physically, that made me realize that I can I can just do more than I thought.
Well, you're hired.
So, should I call your parents, or? No, they'll be fine.
They wanna see me moving forward.
I see.
Well, it's It's important to move forward.

[SPRAY CAN RATTLING] [JUSTIN] Fuck! [KEVIN] Hannah and I, we failed each other.
If we had only tried harder, each of us, to reach out, to understand, to trust each other, to let ourselves help and be helped, it would have made all the difference.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES] [KEVIN] I can't go back and fix my mistake.
I can't change the past.
Olivia.
I know I shouldn't be here, and I know why you've come.

1 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] ["JUST FOR US" PLAYING] Someone wanna take you home Don't let 'em [TONY] I've always been rough around the edges.
Or at least that's what people think.
Maybe it's what I want them to think.
I hate you for making me do this.
No, you don't.
Admit it, you love it, and you love me for it.
[TONY] But Hannah, she saw right through all that.
Okay, what's going on? You've been kinda bitchy all day.
Excuse me? I don't have a bitchy bone in my body.
[CHUCKLES] Okay, fine.
There's a guy at school.
I love this story already.
Who is he? He's artsy.
- Artsy.
- And dramatic.
All code words for "too gay"? No, no, it's not that.
He's just totally not my type.
Does this dramatic artist have a name? - Ryan Shaver.
- The guy with the 'zine? - Mm-hmm.
- [LAUGHS] Holy shit.
Yeah, he's totally not your type.
- Is he into you? - Oh, yeah.
No question.
If you do say so yourself.
Look, he's always smiling at me, he laughs at jokes that are not jokes.
And he, like, touches me on the arm and shit.
And what's the stimulus response when he touches you on the arm? Part of me wants to say, "Watch the leather, homo.
" Other part of me wants to throw him against the locker and kiss him.
[LAUGHING] Oh, dear Lord.
You are in trouble.
- Yeah.
- You have to ask him out.
- Ah, no.
- Come on.
You need to restore my faith in teenage male-kind.
- Well, not all of us are Justin Foley.
- Prove it.
[TONY] She was the kind of friend who challenged me, whether I liked it or not.
Hannah and I had a relationship like well, we kept each other's secrets.
So, what do you know that someone doesn't want you saying in court? I know a lot.
I've done a lot.
But you can't tell the cops? - Or your folks? - Nope.
- So, how bad is it gonna be? - The school called me in, not the Bakers.
The school wants me to talk about how Hannah blamed lots of people and wanted revenge.
- They told you that? - No.
The Bakers' lawyer did.
He also warned me he would have to make me look unreliable.
- Oh, shit.
- I could fuck everything up.
- For the Bakers? - Yeah, for the Bakers, for my family.
For us.
Oh, so we're an "us" now? I mean, yeah, like - until I fuck it up.
- Oh, you won't.
Not us.
[CLAY] Look, don't you get it? It has to be the Clubhouse.
Right.
- Are you high? - Jesus.
No.
- I can't bring that shit home again.
- I'm not.
I'm just tired.
So, if you weren't using, what have you been doing the past 48 hours? - I saw my mom.
- Your mom? I thought you didn't know where she moved.
Well, turns out I lie sometimes.
- Wait, so you went home? - No, I saw my mom.
She gave me some cash.
- She gave you that? - Here.
It's for you.
Consider it rent.
- Till I can find something permanent.
- Keep it.
I don't pay rent anyway.
So If you have all that cash why'd you call me? You said you needed me.
I'm just I'm done with doing fucked-up things.
[SIGHS] Yeah.
I may need you to do one or two more fucked-up things.
[SHOWER RUNNING] [TONY] Me, I try to be a good friend in the way I know how.
[DOOR CREAKS] [DOOR CLOSES] He came back.
Yeah.
Eventually, you have to stop running, I guess.
I'm sorry about the other night.
You didn't say anything I didn't deserve.
I'm angry all the time, Hannah.
I have been since you died.
And I can't tell anyone.
You should tell someone.
Someone who's alive.
I tried to forget you.
I tried so hard.
Then I think of sitting on the roof of the Crestmont.
Or building towers of candy boxes.
Or going off about zombies, or talking about Star Trek.
Star Wars more than Star Trek, but sometimes Star Trek.
Or walking me home from work, or having lunch together.
Or kissing you.
I can't forget kissing you.
I think maybe it was the happiest I've ever been.
For, like, 15 seconds.
I'd give anything to kiss you again.
But you can't.
Ever.
Then why are you here? [TONY] I sometimes let my anger get the best of me.
[MONTGOMERY] Maybe it was one of those bitches who follows Hannah's mom.
The one with all the signs.
They'll have all this cleaned up by game time.
So let's get our heads back in the game, guys.
We can let this get to us, or we can take the field tonight and show these people who we really are.
And who exactly are we, Coach? - Apparently, we're the rapists.
- I don't want to hear that talk, okay? We got a championship season ahead of us starting tonight.
Gonna to prove these people wrong.
How does winning a baseball game prove we're not rapists? Got something to say, Dempsey? No.
Nothing.
You got something to say? - No.
I'll save it for court tomorrow.
- Okay, that's enough.
Ten minutes of long toss.
Let's go! Go, go, go! [TONY] Or if I don't it eats me up inside.
Did you sleep okay? Hmm? Do you feel okay? Yeah, I'm fine, Dad.
What is he doing here? You said he was gone.
You said he ran away.
Hey, he didn't What are you doing? Dad.
- What have you got to say for yourself? - [JESSICA] People are watching.
- I don't give a damn.
- I do! Hey! Who do you think you're hurting right now? - What this boy did to you - He didn't do it.
Dad, please, just get in the car.
[TONY] When we act out of anger or fear You be very careful of yourself, young man.
[TONY] we can hurt people we don't mean to hurt.
After I hooked up with her ex, she called me a slut, a whore, a fat bitch.
- [SONYA] And this was Lindsay? - Yeah.
And, like, I could handle it when it was just one-on-one with her, but when the three of them piled on, it was it was too much.
[SONYA] And can you please name all three girls who bullied you at Ridgeview High? Lindsay Patterson, Alicia Morris, Hannah Baker.
They called me "Suck-Me-Sarah.
" They created a Facebook group where people posted awful memes about me.
They'd always find ways to accidentally run into me in class, or on the bus, or in the bathroom, which is where I ended up eating most of my lunches.
And did you ever tell anyone? My mom.
She told the school, and they were all suspended for a week.
[SONYA] Following this suspension, did the bullying continue? [SARAH] Yes and no.
Lindsay, Alicia, and Hannah, they left me alone, but everyone else at Ridgeview hated me for, you know, being a narc.
I knew it wouldn't get better.
It couldn't.
Not there.
So I dropped out.
[SONYA] So you dropped out of school as a result of the bullying by these girls, including Hannah Baker? [SARAH] Yeah.
[SONYA] No further questions, Your Honor.
Look, we need to get in there.
We've got a plan.
What's the plan? - Boom.
- Seriously? That's the plan? Put those away.
- What? Why? - Why not just break down the door? - Because then the door would be broken.
- Yes.
What I'm saying is we gotta do it without tipping them off that we were there.
- And we do that how? - [SIGHS] Let me handle this.
I'll text you.
[NINA] What do they think that's actually gonna accomplish? It's probably just some losers who just wanted attention and don't give a shit about who it hurts.
Who does it hurt, though? I mean, you and me and anyone who just wants our shit to be ours, you know? - Not, like, burned into a field.
- Right.
- But nobody really knows about you.
- You know what I mean.
Dear God, are these the two most beautiful girls at Liberty High? Hold on, hold on, let me see.
Just a closer inspection.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
The most beautiful.
And I believe one Damon Dawes from Washington agrees, seeing that he's been blowing up my phone about this girl he met yesterday.
- Right? Right? - Yeah, that's nice.
In fact, I've been deputized by Mr.
Dawes to invite you to his place tonight.
Yeah, I can't.
- My dad's, like, crazy on me today, so - [MICHAEL] Just think about it.
- And I'll see you at practice.
- Yes, you will.
This is me.
I'll see you.
[TONY] Hey, what's up, Ryan? Still doing that Internet thing? I'm sorry, we can't all bump into hot boyfriends every time we walk into a boxing gym.
Besides, aren't you testifying today? Why are you here? Yeah, I'm up last.
They don't let you in the courtroom unless you've already gone.
- I wasn't gonna wait at home.
- Aren't your folks going? No, they're, uh They're working.
Do you want me to go? Jesus Christ, no.
No.
That is all I need.
Fine.
Hey, I don't think it's gonna come up.
- Not here.
- No, I'm just saying Just fucking drop it, okay? Fine.
- [POP SONG PLAYS] - Shine on Diamond - I don't know about this.
- Why? I don't know, I mean, look at him.
He's staring at himself in the mirror.
Like you don't use a mirror.
How much pomade does it take you every morning to look like that? That's not the point.
The point is, we're too different.
Different is good, okay? Opposites attract and all that.
- Now go, do some attracting.
- No.
Carpe diem.
Seize the day before it's too late! Okay, okay.
Seize the day.
Seize the fucking day.
Seize the day.
Oh, my, my, my Tony Padilla.
To what do I owe the pleasure? I uh I think you're cute um, and funny and you have a way with words that I'm not entirely sure I understand I am flattered and a-flutter.
Yeah.
My point is, I like you.
And I think you like me? And I'm, you know Words are not really my thing, so I'm not gonna say anything clever or cute.
I just, um Wanna go to an art show with me? You did your research.
What took you so long to finally come to your senses and ask me out? I'm "carpe dieming," apparently.
Seizing the freaking day.
[CHUCKLES] I like it.
You do realize that means "pluck the day," though, right? Uh Saturday.
My, my, my At 5:00.
Text me your address? My, my, my [TONY LAUGHS] - If this backfires - Yeah? - I'm coming straight to you.
- Okay, I will be there for you always.
[CLASS BELL RINGS] [SIGHS] Good morning.
- Uh, I'll talk to you later.
- All right.
Kevin.
Gary, good morning.
Yeah.
I wasn't expecting to see you here this morning.
Why not? Well, your employment record is currently under review - by the superintendent's office.
- Well, I'm aware.
I'm sure you'll let me know what they decide.
All right.
So, uh I mean, what what did you think was going to happen next? I'm just curious.
I didn't game it out, Gary.
I spoke my truth.
So, you thought it was coincidental that our field was vandalized just hours after you spoke your truth? The field was vandalized for one reason only.
And he'll be taking the stand and have plenty of time to defend himself.
Yeah, okay.
Well, until the superintendent's review is completed, I think it's best that you have no direct contact with any students.
You understand? You don't straighten a kid's collar without consulting me first.
- Are we clear? - Yes, sir, we're clear.
[TONY] Even when you try to do the right thing it can get you into trouble.
How did you guys even find this place? Find? No, you don't find the Clubhouse - You're invited.
- Oh, shit.
I just realized, - I have a test today, fourth period - [BRYCE] Sheri fucking Holland.
Never thought I'd see you here.
[SCOTT] She came bearing gifts.
Oh, shit.
[CHUCKLES] Juvie was good for you.
All right, ladies first.
[TONY] High school can be messed up.
People can get hurt.
Hannah wanted people to know about that.
So you're saying she wanted them to suffer like she was suffering? - [DENNIS] Objection.
Leading.
- I'll rephrase.
Tony, why did Hannah want you to make sure that people listened to the tapes? Uh To So that they would understand.
Understand what? What she was going through.
And what, to the best of your knowledge, was she going through? Uh, she was in a lot of pain.
And so she wanted the recipients of those tapes to feel pain as well? - No, I don't think that's - She didn't want them to feel pain? I guess so.
And, in your experience, is that what a bully does? Uh, she wanted them to be held accountable.
And she wanted you to make sure that they got the message, correct? - Yes, ma'am.
- In fact, you held onto the tapes, stayed quiet for weeks before you finally gave them to her parents, who ultimately alerted the proper authorities, correct? - Correct, yeah.
- Because it was so important that you made sure that the individuals got the message that they were responsible.
[DENNIS] Objection.
Leading.
Tony, did Hannah ever blame the school on her tapes? It was the way the school was, that they did nothing at all to help her after she Did Hannah at any point say, "I blame the school"? No.
- No further questions.
- It's not fair.
You don't understand - what she was going through - Nothing further.
You wanna break her in? It's a new pipe.
Do you want to do the honors? Oh.
Yeah, but I have papers.
Oh, come on.
Hit that shit, girl.
Come on.
What the fuck is that? Really? You call that a hit? Come on.
Hit it hard.
Be a man.
- Again.
- All right.
Atta girl.
Oh, shit.
- [COUGHING] - [LAUGHS] - That's a good hit.
- Here.
- No, I'm pitching tonight.
- What? Yeah.
Okay, fine.
Here, Scott.
Uh, and these two idiots are also playing.
- Come on.
- Seriously? - Fuck.
Come on.
- Guess you're on your own.
Picture time.
No, I look like shit.
Come on, it's tradition.
No one leaves without taking a shot.
Come on.
And you couldn't look like shit if you tried.
All right.
Yeah, get a little closer.
There it is.
Smile, bitches.
[CLICKS, WHIRRS] They put my picture in this box with, like, a hundred others.
- Like Like trophies? - [JUSTIN] Insurance.
What happens in the Clubhouse stays in the Clubhouse.
We have to get those pictures.
We'll go during the game.
- You go.
I'm out.
- Wait.
Why? I can't go back there.
Yeah, I get it.
- Nina! Hey.
- Hey.
Can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah.
Um, I mean, Michael's waiting for me 'cause we try to get in a few miles at lunch, but what's up? Yeah, about that.
Did, like, something happen between you and Garrett? No.
Why? Come on.
You're the person who tells me the truth.
[SIGHS] Well, I mean, nothing happened, really.
It's just, he's just been getting on my nerves lately.
He wants to go all deep and talk about our feelings all the time.
It's exhausting.
Your feelings? He's been asking questions, okay? Just based off some stuff that happened, like, physically with us.
So Shit.
Okay.
I get that.
But, I mean, most guys don't even bother asking questions.
Maybe it's a good thing.
How? I don't want to talk about that with him.
Well, you talk about it with me.
Yeah, because you understand it.
- How do you know he won't? - It'll just get in the way.
So you just start up with Michael? And what happens if he starts asking questions, too? Well, you just started up with Damon, and that seemed to go all right, so It didn't! It was a big mistake.
I freaked out and I started sleeping on my parents' floor again.
Well, then you gave too much.
I feel like maybe you haven't dealt with all your shit after all.
Oh, so you're gonna tell me now? While you walk around staring at Justin like you're still in love? I mean, what's that about? Deal with that shit.
You know, I was just trying to help you, J, but maybe that was a mistake.
[SCOFFS] Hey.
Come on, let's talk.
I can't really As long as you don't miss any more of the semester and you sign up for summer school, I think I can help you get you the credits you need so you can graduate with your class barely.
- Thank you.
- Can you get your shit together? - Can you get the grades? - Yes.
Spoken to your mother since you've been back? - I don't know where she is.
- Bullshit.
I visited her last week.
And I know she's staying at the house her boyfriend used to cook in till he had to take it out of town.
How do you even know about I know that you're staying with Clay Jensen now.
So, what is your plan, long-term? I'll find a job, find a place.
I'm used to being on my own, okay? And how has that worked out for you, being on your own? Justin I'm not gonna be at this job much longer.
And whoever replaces me is gonna want you back at your mom's house.
- I've got it handled, Porter.
Thanks.
- Sit.
Listen.
This is gonna be hard for you, and you need to let people help.
And you need to let go of your past wrongs and figure out what can you do right.
You understand? Justin, take care of yourself.
Yes, sir.
I will.
[TONY] My anger is so powerful sometimes, I don't know what to do with it.
Isn't it true you're currently enrolled in a program for anger management? Yes, sir.
And this program is specifically designed for people who struggle with physical violence and aggression, correct? Uh, yeah, that's correct.
Isn't it true that the court ordered you to take part in this program, Tony? Um It's a condition of my probation, yes.
And isn't it true that this probation stems from an arrest for assault? - Two arrests, yeah.
- Two strikes.
One more and you could be sent to juvenile detention, correct? Uh, yeah.
Isn't it true that in the first assault, you jumped a man from behind? I caught him breaking into my car.
And in the second, you and your brothers ganged up on an innocent man, correct? He wasn't innocent.
He was a drug dealer and he was selling drugs to my sister.
But he had no record, is that correct? No, he didn't.
You can't help but lash out when provoked, can you? [TONY] You know that horoscope stuff is bullshit, right? You really think a planet billions of light-years away - can affect your lotto numbers? - [RYAN CHUCKLES] [RYAN] You know, Scorpios are very skeptical by nature.
- [CHUCKLES] - But luckily, I'm a Leo, - which means I can handle you.
- Yeah? We're both emotional, though, in completely different ways, which means we'll probably wind up killing each other at some point.
Well, that's encouraging.
But in the meantime, the sex is going to be, like, mind-blowing.
- Oh, you think so, huh? - I do.
I've had a really nice time today, which means my horoscope was right.
What, so, you like me, but you don't want to kiss me in public? - It's not that.
- Is that it? No, I just, uh I think I should take things slow for once.
Besides, if we're gonna end up killing each other, we should make the most of our time together.
Faggots.
What did you just say? Which one is the wife? - Are you fucking kidding me? - Just ignore him.
It's the 21st century, you fucking asshole.
Fuck you, faggot.
- Huh? - Whoa.
- Say it to my face.
- Tony.
Tony.
Tony, let's go.
- You should listen to your bitch.
- Whoa.
- You should shut your mouth.
- Don't touch me, faggot! - Tony! Tony, stop! - Get off.
[GROANS] - Tony! We have to go! - Get out of here! [GRUNTING] [MAN] Call the police.
[BYSTANDER] Nine-one-one? Yeah Uh Where I live sometimes you gotta take matters into your own hands.
So you follow your own sense of justice, is that correct? Yes, sir.
So shouldn't we regard your testimony today as coming from your own sense of justice? - Objection.
- Withdrawn.
Tony, when Hannah left the tapes at your door, did she say anything? Uh, no.
I didn't talk to her.
And what about a note? Did she leave any written instructions? No, just the tapes.
So when you stated earlier that Hannah blamed the people she named on the tapes and wanted them to suffer, you were making an assumption, isn't that correct? I don't think I was making an assumption that [TONY] Mrs.
Baker Hannah asked me to keep secrets for her.
I wanted to honor that.
Yes, I was.
Yeah, I was making an assumption.
An assumption not based on your knowledge of Hannah or her intentions, isn't that correct? - Yes.
- And isn't it true that there's no particular reason why Hannah chose you - to receive those tapes? - Yes.
So isn't it true you have no way of knowing why Hannah left those tapes? Yes.
We're brothers.
All of us.
I mean, we're fucking family.
There's been there's been a lot of shit thrown our way recently.
There are a lot of people who are trying to tear us apart, but family stays together.
Look, you guys, they can burn our field, but they can't change the ground beneath it.
That ground out there is sacred.
That ground is where we make our stand.
The world is divided between people who get that and the people who don't.
And I also just want to say that I'm proud to be sharing the field with each and every one of you because we're all fighters.
We're winners.
And we stand together.
I fucking love you guys.
- Aww! - We love you, too, Brycey! All right, all right.
Let's get out there and let's fucking do this! [CHEERING] [MAN] Strike him out, Bryce! Let's go! [WOMAN] Come on, Bryce! [UMPIRE] Strike three! [FANS CHEERING] [TONY] I can't explain how she was feeling or what exactly she was trying to say.
But even if I can't say how she was feeling, I can still tell you the kind of person she was.
I can tell you she was brave and loyal [FANS WHOOPING] [UMPIRE] Strike! [CHEERING] [TONY] and always tried to do the right thing, even when it wasn't easy.
- I wanted the change-up.
- I wanted to throw the heat.
- He's catching up to you.
- Not yet, he's not.
Just give me the change-up, okay? [WOMAN] Come on, guys! [SPITS] [UMPIRE] Strike three! [CHEERING] Time! Time! - What are you doing? - That's 5 Ks in a row with the fastball.
- Why fuck that up? - Why didn't you shake me off? [BRYCE] Why don't you just catch what I throw and be happy? It's when you start thinking that shit gets fucked up.
[ZACH] You just gave a whole fucking speech about teamwork, - but that was bullshit, too, wasn't it? - Fuck is your problem? You're my fucking problem.
We both know that Hannah didn't lie on those tapes.
Zach, come on, man.
We leave this stuff off the field, right? Sorry, Coach.
I can't anymore.
Dempsey.
Dempsey, come on! Seriously? You'd think they'd know better than to just leave this shit lying around.
Except then they'd know better than to take pictures in the first place.
Shit.
- What are you doing in here? - [CLAY] We know about the Clubhouse.
We know everything, and we're not the only ones.
Oh, you know everything? I don't think so.
We know enough.
- Hey, just back off, Dempsey.
- Or what, Justin? Gonna come at me? I wasn't scared of you even before you fell apart.
Do what you want, Zach.
I've had the shit beat out of me once this week already.
It's not gonna stop us.
- Really? - Yes.
'Cause it's gonna keep happening, Clay.
To you, too, Justin.
It doesn't stop.
You can't take shots at the top and expect to not get hit back.
I'm not afraid.
Good.
You already have three of these.
There's the rest.
Wait, wait.
It was you? Why the big mystery? Why couldn't you just talk to me? - Tell me what was going on? - 'Cause I'm a fucking coward.
And you're not.
[TONY] I try to do right by my friends, to be strong.
[DOOR CLOSES] To be true like Hannah.
[DOOR UNLOCKS, OPENS] Sorry! [DOOR SHUTS] Phil mixed up two prescriptions.
Well, nearly.
It was a disaster.
It Jackie? [SIGHS] [TONY] But sometimes a friendship can't take the truth.
So you find yourself trying to be someone you're not.
- [VOICES OVERLAPPING] - [FAINT MUSIC PLAYING] Sorry.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Just very sorry.
Asshole! You're just in time.
The set's about to start.
Should we try and find a spot closer to the stage? Yeah, let's go.
The boys are already up there.
- We should get going.
- You never I mean, they're all here, too? Of course.
They're not gonna miss a good show.
Let's go, come on! All right, coming through.
- [CYRUS] Move, move, move.
- Sorry.
- Hey! - What's up? You made it.
- You all ready? - Yeah! Let's do this shit.
- All right! Here we go again.
- [CROWD CHEERING] Get the party started.
[PLAYING PUNK METAL MUSIC] [SCREAMING LYRICS] [CHEERING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] It's rough out there tonight, huh? - Oh, my God, are you okay? - I'm fine.
Okay.
Can we talk? Because you've been avoiding me for, like, two days straight.
- No, I wasn't.
I mean, I - No, it's okay.
Look, I know what happened at the movies.
- I don't know what you think happened - Don't have to be embarrassed.
I even read that it's totally normal.
It's not even a thing.
- Seriously, it happens - I know, but just shut up! Okay? Look, I I don't know what you think happened, but I left because you're fucking boring and 'cause I don't like you like that.
What the fuck? Tyler? Okay, wait.
No, hold on.
Cyrus, just let No, let me explain real quick No one fucking talks to my sister like that.
Get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out! - [STAMMERS] - Go! Go! Get the fuck out! You must think I'm pretty messed up after hearing all that stuff about me today, about my past.
Obviously, it's not anything I'm proud of.
Tony, we've all done things we're not proud of.
And they seem to find out about the one thing you wish they wouldn't.
Actually, they didn't.
Hannah didn't trust me with the tapes because we were friends.
She trusted me because I owed her.
- Hannah - Shit, Tony, are you okay? I did something stupid.
The cops are coming.
What? Why? What happened? Look, I can't get busted again.
I could get locked up.
Please hide me.
There's no time! [DISTANT SIREN WAILS] Oh, shit, okay uh Go down the hall to the back office.
I'll take care of it.
Go! [SIREN CHIRPS] Can I help you? Miss, we're responding to an assault.
Oh, my God.
An assault? Yeah, suspect is a Hispanic male, late teens or early 20s, last seen fleeing on foot in the area, wearing a black leather jacket.
Have you seen anyone come in here matching that description? No.
No, I haven't.
All right.
[SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS, SHUTS] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to drag you into this.
I went too far, I know I did.
I know you think I'm this sweet, nice girl, but I was an asshole to someone at my old school.
I was trying to fit in with these girls, and they were ganging up on her.
And I thought, better to be one of them than to be her.
So, what ended up happening? A bunch of stuff went down, and, uh now I'm here.
I just I wish I could take it all back.
You know? Hannah was a friend to me and she kept my secrets.
I wanted to do the same for her today.
Thank you for telling me that.
I'm glad to know that Hannah kept your secret.
And I understand why she wanted to protect you.
I just I wish I could've done that for you today in court.
No, it's my record.
That's on me.
Not you.
[SIGHS] I guess we're all carrying stuff around, right? What? [PINGS] No, you didn't.
Fucking Marcus.
Tyler, we need to talk.
What happened to you? Nothing.
I was at a concert with Cyrus.
Uh, I'm fine.
Listen, Tyler, Marcus Cole's father was here a little while ago.
He says that you and Cyrus are blackmailing Marcus online? Okay, you guys, Marcus is a liar and a creep, okay? He goes around and acts like this great guy, but he treats girls like crap.
Did you hear what was on his tape? Whatever Marcus did is beside the point.
If you have a problem with someone, you tell us or a teacher.
You don't just go around trying to settle the score.
Honey, it's just not like you to do something like this.
Did Cyrus pressure you into doing this? He He said it would teach Marcus a lesson.
I don't want you spending time with him anymore.
Okay! Fine! Whatever.
I won't.
Good.
But that doesn't mean you don't still have consequences.
We're gonna confiscate all your electronics, starting with your phone.
Okay? This behavior stops now.
Okay.
And your cameras.
No.
Please Mom [MR.
DOWN] Sorry, Tyler.
But, I Hi.
I don't know if you know who I am No, I know who you are.
I understand your anger.
I do.
I know you wanted to get on that stand today and tell everyone who you thought Hannah was.
So did I, but I failed.
And I'm here to make it right.
She was a good person.
She was a great friend.
And what she did to you, there's no excuse for that.
I know she hurt you.
She knew it, too.
Now, I'm not asking you to forgive her, but you need to know she was sorry.
She told me how sorry she felt.
[FAINT BUZZING] [BUZZING] Hello.
This is she.
Oh, my God.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Olivia Baker.
[INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [GLASS CRUNCHES] [TONY] So I promised myself that the next time things get tough for me, the next time I find myself struggling or being tested I'm gonna think about the example she set for me and hope that I can find the strength to do the right thing.
[SIGHS] These photos go back, like, years.
It's no wonder these fucking baseball guys are so fucking tight.
I mean, they're all covering each other's asses for this shit.
These poor girls.
That's the thing I don't get.
I mean Why are these girls getting themselves into this situation in the first place? Seriously, Clay? You're gonna blame the girls? No, I just Look, I mean, this girl's laughing.
Like she's having fun.
Oh, my God.
This is Nina, that girl on the track team.
She's Jessica's friend.
[JUSTIN] Shit, really? Clay, you don't know what was happening in this photo.
And you don't know what happened after.
But clearly, no one's forcing her to be there.
Look, girls don't just "get themselves" into bad situations.
Guys make the situations bad.
You don't know what that feels like, to be a girl in that room.
Uh, yeah, no.
I guess you're right.
- I'm just saying it's complicated.
- [CLAY WHISPERS] Yeah.
Shit.
Shit, guys.
Look.
[CLAY] Oh, my God.
Wait, that's That's ChlÃe.
He did that to his own girlfriend? - This is how we take him down.
- What do you mean? She's unconscious in these pictures.
He's fucking raping her.
If we show her these, maybe we can get her to report it.
Maybe we can get her to turn against him.
You think she will? I think we have to try.

1 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [BRYCE] People talk a lot about what it means to be a member of a team.
["HEAD ON" PLAYS] - As soon as I get my head around you - [PLAYER] Shred, shred! I come around Catching sparks off you I get an electric charge from you - [GRUNTS] - [WHISTLE BLOWS] [BRYCE] Thanks, man.
[CROWD CHEERING] [BRYCE] The brotherhood, the sense of belonging to something greater than yourself.
[PLAYER 1] Set, go! [PLAYER 2] Hold the ball! Hold the ball! [PLAYER 3] Hey, it's going right, it's going right! Throwing right, throwing right.
Makes you wanna feel Makes you wanna try Makes you wanna blow The stars from the sky I can't stand up I can't cool down I can't get my head Off the ground [BRYCE] It's about fighting together, but it's also about family.
About knowing who will be there for you, always.
As soon as I get my head Around you I come around Catching sparks off you And all I ever got from you Was all I ever [BRYCE] And when it's right, when it's 11 guys working as one, there's nothing like it.
- [PLAYER] Set, go! - [ALL GRUNTING] The world could die in pain And I wouldn't feel no shame And there's nothing Holding me to blame Makes you wanna feel Makes you wanna try Makes you wanna blow The stars from the sky And I'm taking myself To a dirty part of town Where all my troubles Can't be found - [CROWD ROARING] - [BRYCE] No greater feeling in the world.
[ALL CHEERING] [CHEERING] - Fuck me, you're heavy.
- Hey! Yeah, man, no wonder Westfield couldn't tackle your ass.
Fuck you guys.
My fat ass saved yours, butterfingers.
- [ZACH] Hey! - Ouch! Lucky I was doubled up all night or else you wouldn't have gotten shit.
- And I thank you.
- Dude, that catch? Insane! You're so getting your dick sucked tonight! Monty, you wanna do the honors? You know what? I would.
That's how amazing that catch was.
Party at your place, Walker? - No.
- His parents are in town.
- We're hitting the docks.
- See you guys.
See ya.
[CHATTER] - Great game, Bryce! - Thanks, Mr.
Dempsey.
Looking for someone? No, I, um I was just No.
I'm Hannah.
We met at Kat's party.
Yes.
Yeah, no, I remembered.
I I was just It's cool.
Yeah.
Probably all those concussions out there.
Yeah, something like that.
Didn't know you were a football fan.
- My mom made me come.
- Oh, okay, okay.
Yeah.
She said it'd be good for me to meet people, make some friends.
And now she's off somewhere making friends for herself, and here I am.
Well, at least she's here.
Mine are apparently still in Zurich or wherever the hell it is this week.
Can your parents take mine with them sometime? Absolutely.
I'll talk to them about that.
Good game, man.
- I, uh I should go find my mother.
- Sure.
Sure.
[BRYCE] Hey, friend.
Let's hang out sometime.
[BRYCE] Maybe that's why Hannah pursued me, because she had never felt that that sense of belonging.
[NORA] Aren't the glasses a bit much? Yeah, I haven't worn these in, like, forever.
Warren thinks they make him look more empathetic, relatable.
And can't he just be those things? Look, Warren is the best there is at reading a jury.
Our family's on trial today.
You shouldn't even be in that room, for Christ's sake.
We could've fought off a bullshit subpoena for a rinky-dink lawsuit.
I got this.
I spent, like, four hours with Warren and his guys.
- We're good.
- [NORA] Are we good? The reporters out front didn't seem to think so.
Enough.
The kid doesn't need any more static.
[JESSICA] If she doesn't know this happened to her, she's gonna be destroyed.
And once she does, I'm not gonna be the one who tells her that the whole world needs to know, too.
They're gonna have to take down Bryce without her.
- He's just going to lie.
- [JESSICA] Maybe.
But you go up there thinking you'll know what to say, and then it ends up going another way completely, you know? Yeah, which is how I know we can't count on them to get Bryce.
Look, if we don't stop this, there will be more ChlÃes and Bryces and Ninas.
Oh, my God.
[CLAY] This is proof, Jessica.
Proof of who Bryce is, who they all are.
Proof that you're not alone.
And that makes it easier? What, like we're some part of a fucking club? Jesus, you guys Wait, we That might be evidence.
Well, it doesn't belong to you.
Aren't you pissed off? I've made a lot of enemies in this town.
It's Bryce.
- You think so? - Yes.
No, he wouldn't get his hands dirty with this.
But who else would it be? Bryce has money.
And boys like him, men like him, they have protectors and enablers and people with lots to lose if they're found out.
Can I come to court with you today? Okay.
Why are you in this picture? I'm sure I can't tell you anything worse than what you're imagining.
[CLAY] I don't know.
So far, things have been worse than I ever would've imagined.
What do you want me to say, Clay? Would you believe nothing happened? [CLAY STAMMERS] How did you end up in the Clubhouse? I mean, whose jacket is it? You know I dated Justin.
He said he didn't know about the Clubhouse.
And you believe him? I don't know.
I So, what do you wanna hear? That I dated half the baseball team? That they got me high and fucked me blind? I I wanna know the truth.
I told you my truth, but you don't believe me.
You say you love me, but you're always willing to believe the worst of me.
[JESSICA] Clay Jensen has the rest.
They're safe.
I know how much you talk about your story being yours, so I thought you should get to decide what to do with this.
Yeah, but the thing is is that this isn't my story.
This is the lie.
That I was into it and having fun, you know? And I guess I was, you know, until But there's no picture of that, is there? No proof.
You know, maybe if there was, maybe maybe I'd be dealing with my shit a little better, right? Nina, I am so sorry that I said that stuff to you yesterday, honestly.
You were right, though.
I I cheated on Garrett with Michael.
- And when you called me out - I didn't mean to call you out.
No, but you should have.
[NINA BREATHES SHAKILY] I wanted to be strong for you to be what you needed, but I'm not.
And I don't think that I ever will be.
Maybe we're just gonna never stop being victims.
You said that Hannah pursued you after that football game at the beginning of your junior year.
Did it ever turn physical? Yes.
We had kind of an on-again, off-again thing.
[SONYA] So you had sex more than once? [BRYCE] We did.
[SONYA] So, Hannah initiated this "on-again, off-again thing"? Yes, she did.
She took me to Hickman's Bridge which, honestly, I remember thinking was kind of creepy.
[HANNAH] I like the idea that somebody built this thing that holds people up, helps them get where they need to go.
And yet, one wrong turn and you're plummeting down, down, down, splat.
Game over.
- Did you take me out here to murder me? - [LAUGHS] No, I just [LAUGHS] You know, we take it for granted Life and, like, how precarious it is.
I don't know, coming here, it helps me step out of mine sometimes.
Yeah.
And to remember how precious life is.
Exactly.
[SONYA] How do you mean "it was creepy"? Well, just the whole bridge thing.
Being obsessed with a place like that.
I just wish I had realized it might have been a sign.
[SONYA] And how many times did you go to Hickman's Bridge? Gosh, I don't know.
Um, quite a few.
I guess it kind of became our place.
[SONYA] And what did you do there? [BRYCE] Sometimes we just made out, um, looked at the stars.
Sometimes we made love.
- Are you sure you want to? - I'm sure.
[SONYA] Did things ever evolve into a committed relationship? Not really.
Did you want it to? Um, I had a great time with Hannah, but she wasn't really girlfriend material.
Hannah had a reputation.
And she didn't deserve it at all, but you know how kids are.
I was too ashamed to admit that I was having sex with her.
And how did Hannah feel about that? I think she wanted more.
She would always hang around after football games, after baseball practice ["HIGH" PLAYS] Isn't it, like, freedom, being on your own, though? I mean, I think your life sounds amazing.
Yeah, yeah, it mostly is.
- That looks good on you.
- [CHUCKLES] - Let me get a picture.
- Oh, no way.
No photos.
- Come on! You're so beautiful.
- [LAUGHS] I would probably hide the pipe, though.
You don't want people to think you're a complete stoner.
[BRYCE LAUGHS] All right.
So beautiful.
- Unh-unh.
- Oh, God, no! - I don't want to see it.
- What? - I don't want to look at myself.
- Seriously? Because I could look at you forever.
High Over the north star Sleepless, so far Together, we are high Trapped in the holiday affair A new silence filled the air I rest my head on your shoulder There's nowhere else I'd rather be Right there, a little bit slower [HANNAH] I wanted to be with him forever.
I was in love with him.
[SONYA] Bryce, you said that Hannah wanted a more serious relationship, yes? [BRYCE] Yes.
- [SONYA] Did she tell you so? - [BRYCE] She did.
- When? - The night of my party.
And that was the party on September 30th? Correct.
And what made you think that Hannah wanted something more serious? Because she told me so.
After we had sex, she said that she wanted to be exclusive.
And I said, you know, "I like you, but as a friend.
" [SONYA] So how do you explain Hannah's report that you did something to her at that party? She lied to Mr.
Porter.
Why would she do that? Because she was hurt and angry.
I I get that.
I tried to let her down gently.
Hannah really was a fantastic girl, but, look, she let her emotions carry her away, right? In high school it's emotional.
What if Marcus calls your dad, too, huh? We have to get him back, you know? I'm trying to look out for you, okay? What about my sister? I told you, I'm sorry about everything [BOY] Hey, Tyler.
You wanna go to a movie sometime? [MOANS] - [BOYS LAUGH] - [GIRLS GASP] Thank you very much.
Mr.
Wentworth.
[GIRL] Here you go.
[RICK] Thank you.
Paxton.
Thank you very much.
I was surprised to see you in class.
Oh, yeah, I uh figured my education was more important than sitting around a courtroom, you know.
'Course.
Plus, can't play ball without that average, right? [SCOFFS] Uh, listen, Coach, I Look, you had a disagreement, okay? It happens.
Sometimes brothers fight.
But that doesn't mean they're not still your family.
Those guys aren't my family.
Well, what about me? Wasn't I there for you when you came to me last summer? - Yeah.
- Didn't we figure that out together? How to be strong for your family, your mom? Little May? Zach, you think you can be there for your team and for me now? You don't get to do that, okay? Just because you were there, you think you can? You know, if you were any kind of father, to this team or to anyone, you would've stopped their bullshit years ago.
That means I quit.
Bryce, you've gotten physical with other classmates against their wishes, haven't you? Uh, not that I remember, no.
Not Tyler Down? Isn't it true that you threw Tyler Down against a locker? Oh, maybe, but that's just guys messing around.
He He knew I was joking.
So you think Tyler thought you were messing around? - [SONYA] Objection.
- Withdrawn.
Let's talk about this party that you mentioned.
It was on September 30th of last year, right? - Correct.
- It was a Saturday? - Yes.
- It was a nice night? Lots of stars, full moon? Yeah.
- And your parents were out of town? - Yes.
You were celebrating a big football win from the night before, right? We were celebrating a loss, actually.
- Uh - [BOYS LAUGH] [BRYCE LAUGHS] We don't win all that often.
[DENNIS] You were celebrating a loss, and people had a drink or two? Yes.
- Maybe three or four? - Sure.
- And Hannah Baker was there? - Yes.
And she was somebody that you knew well, - but who you weren't dating, right? - Right.
- And Hannah got in the hot tub with you? - Yes.
And everybody else got out of the hot tub? Yes.
- And you started to make out with her? - Yeah.
And you wanted to have sex with her, right? Yes.
- And you got really into it? - Sure.
And you assumed that she was into it, too, - correct? - Yes.
So you turned her around to take her from behind, right? Yes.
- You pulled down her underwear, right? - Yes.
And you took your own suit off as well, correct? - Yes.
- [DENNIS] And, Bryce, you usually use protection, don't you? Uh, I do, usually.
But you didn't use protection with her on that night, correct? Correct.
[DENNIS] And you two didn't talk about STDs or pregnancies, right? [BRYCE] We did not, no.
And she never did actually say, "I want to have sex with you," - isn't that correct? - Correct.
And she didn't make any specific gestures to indicate consent, - isn't that correct? - What, like a thumbs-up? - Did she give you a thumbs-up? - She did not.
Then you had sex with her against her will, isn't that correct? No.
No, that is not correct.
She came on to me.
She came on to you, but she never said she wanted to have sex with you, - isn't that correct? - She clearly wanted to hook up.
But she never gave you her consent, isn't that right? I I knew what she wanted.
You knew what she wanted, and yet when she went to the school counselor and reported that she had been assaulted, that was a lie? - Correct.
- Why would she lie? - [SONYA] Objection.
Calls for speculation.
- [DENNIS] I'll rephrase.
Was there anything in your encounter that would have led Hannah to report that she had been raped? [SIGHS] I I wish I knew.
I would never do that to any girl.
When I think about my mom or my girlfriend [WHISPERS] Guys, Chloe took off.
[BRYCE] I would never want anyone to hurt them.
And I never hurt Hannah.
[BOY 1] But I saw it.
- [BOY 2] Oh.
- [BRYCE] Ah! [BOYS LAUGHING, CHATTERING] He lies through his fucking teeth and everybody shakes his hand.
- Are we sure he lied? - Jesus, Clay, come on.
Those fucking glasses? [ALEX] We can't tell Jessica about any of this.
We have to tell Jessica.
We need Chloe.
Hey, Kevin.
Coach.
Listen.
Have you been talking to Zach Dempsey? No, not lately.
Why? He's talking about quitting the team because of this thing with Bryce.
Mm-hmm.
"This thing.
" - You mean that Bryce is a rapist.
- [SCOFFS] Okay.
Kev, come on.
Innocent until proven guilty, huh? So you think he's innocent? I think he is.
I think that this is a witch hunt.
A troubled girl took her own life, and we want to blame, but it's not that simple.
I would hate to see someone's future be ruined because of it.
I would've thought you of all people would appreciate that, Kev.
No one wants a record.
[MR.
PORTER CHUCKLES] No.
No, you're right.
No one wants to be on the wrong side of the law.
What do you want? I heard you walked out of court today while Bryce was on the stand.
Look, I know you're the one who crossed out all that bullshit about me in the stall.
Why? Because you were on the squad.
I wanted to protect you.
I had already quit by then.
Do you remember going to a place called the Clubhouse? [CHLOE SIGHS] This is gonna be hard to look at, okay? Do you remember this happening? [CHLOE GASPS] Chloe.
You don't remember, do you? [CHLOE EXHALES] Why would he do this? Because because he's a bad guy.
He's sick.
He's done this to me and you and who knows who else.
And he takes pictures, or, in my case, puts them up on a whiteboard at school.
- Oh, God.
Jess.
- What? I never I I thought those pictures would scare you into not calling Bryce out in court.
Wait, you put them up? - I'm so sorry.
- What else have you done? It was just the pictures.
I just I wanted to believe the rumors about you were true.
God, he fucking lied to me.
Do you wanna do something about it? What if it's true? Jesus, what if it's true? How could you possibly believe it's true? The stuff about Zach was true.
Zach's a good person.
Deep down, he's a lot like you.
Oh, God, don't say shit like that.
Zach's just like the rest of them.
Zach, and Montgomery, and Scott, and Bryce.
And Justin? Justin let him rape Jessica.
Justin would give his life to do that over.
He should.
He should give his life.
He's your friend.
He's not my friend.
I was your friend.
So tell me he was lying.
Tell me Bryce was lying about everything now.
Jesus, Hannah, tell me he was lying! - He told lies.
- It was all lies.
All of it.
Don't think about it, Clay.
Just think about me.
Think about touching me.
Think about hugging me.
How it felt when we were close.
No, no! Stop it.
I don't ever want to think about that again.
Okay.
Fine.
Just tell me what's true.
I need to know the truth.
Here we are.
Tape 12.
If you've listened this far and you haven't heard your name yet, well, I bet you know exactly what's coming now.
- Or maybe you don't have any idea.
- No.
- No! Damn it, no! Shut up! - Could that be true? - Don't do this! Leave me alone.
- Can a person be that sick? - Let's find out.
- Leave me alone! [DOOR OPENS] Clay.
Clay, what what is it? [CLAY CRYING] I can't.
I can't do this.
Clay, listen.
Jess talked to Chloe.
She's gonna meet with the lawyers.
We're gonna get him.
[DENNIS] ChlÃe, Mrs.
Rice, our window is closing here.
To be clear, testifying that Bryce raped you on campus, you'd help support the argument that Liberty's protection of rapists allowed more rapes to happen and refute Bryce's testimony that he had consensual sex with Hannah.
- Do you understand? - I I think so.
[OLIVIA] You mentioned, uh, your little sister? - Amelia.
- Amelia.
If you decide to testify in that courtroom, maybe the next girl, maybe even Amelia will be safer.
ChlÃe, I know this is a lot.
We know it.
And I know I'm asking you to do the thing that I couldn't do, that Hannah couldn't do.
But if you could do this for all of us, whatever happens next, we have your back.
It's up to you, sweetheart.
It's whatever you decide.
[MACKENZIE] Hey.
Hey.
Listen, I told one friend.
I was I mean, I was just trying to figure out what I did wrong so I told one friend, and she's an asshole and she told someone else, and it just it got out of control.
I'm sorry.
[CYRUS] Mack.
Cyrus, I'm talking to Tyler.
Come on.
The Coke machine at the commons is giving out doubles again.
[BOYS CHEERING] Jesus.
I would love to end those motherfuckers.
Right? Then let's do it.
Nah.
We wouldn't want you to get a bloody nose or anything.
[TOBY LAUGHS] I never thought I'd be thanking Clay Jensen for a ride.
[BOYS CHATTERING] [CHATTER CONTINUES] Fuck me.
[JUSTIN] You're a goddamn liar.
This does not end well.
[JUSTIN] You never hooked up with Hannah.
You would've told me.
Why? Because we were best friends and I told you everything? - [JUSTIN] I should kill you.
- Hey, chill out.
[LAUGHS] Still gonna hide behind your boys, Bryce? I'm not hiding.
You wanna go? [STUDENTS CLAMORING] [TONY] Damn it.
I don't want to fight you.
Just breathe.
Faggot.
You fucking coward faggot.
Oh, yes! - Let's go, motherfuckers! - Yeah! - [BOYS SHOUTING] - ["EVERYTHING'S THE SAME" PLAYING] Look at my face See my pride Out of touch for a while Get off! Get In my place, I'm on trial Get the fuck off! Spent too long in denial Now I don't get it Now Now I can't get it Now No, I don't get it Now [ECHOES] No, I can't - [GRUNTING] - [STUDENTS SHOUTING] [GRUNTS] What the fuck is your problem, psycho? You could've stopped it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That night at the party.
Hannah and Bryce.
Look, I didn't see anything and neither did you.
Hannah's dead because of us.
Shut shut the fuck up.
You're gonna go to jail.
[MR.
PORTER] Guys, no.
Hey, stop! Hey, hey! Guys! Hey, stop! [RICK] Boys! Hey! [ALL SHOUTING] What the fuck are you pushing me for? Take a fucking shot, man.
Come on! - Fucking boys.
- Disgusting.
[ALARM BLARING] [SHOUTING CONTINUES] What? Why didn't you hit me? [SCOFFS] You look pretty bad already.
Which you helped with.
I didn't.
Bullshit.
I play baseball.
That doesn't make me a fucking rapist.
[DOOR OPENS] - [COACH SNORING] - [DOOR CLOSES] [WOMAN] Bryce Walker.
Can you come with us, please? [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] - Mr.
Jensen - Just a minute, Coach.
- No talking, no devices.
- It's an emergency.
Chloe's testifying for the Bakers.
[SCOFFS] Only you could talk us past Coach Patrick.
- That man still loves you.
- Yeah, I guess.
Oh, no.
- [CLAY] No.
No, no, no! - [TONY] What is it? Fuck.
Wait, the the box.
- The box, it's gone.
- Jesus, you left them in the fucking car? What was I supposed to do? Carry it around? Put it in my locker? It's child pornography, for fuck's sake.
It's Bryce.
It had to be Bryce.
He was out ahead of us.
No.
There's no way he had any time.
And he was with that lawyer.
Well, maybe they both did it.
We are so fucked.
You lost them? - Jesus, keep your voice down.
- What the fuck, Justin? - Bryce took them.
- Look, we'll get them back.
How? How are we gonna get them back? [CHLOE] It's in the woods, behind the field.
It's this secret place that you have to be invited to, unless you're on the baseball team.
And who invited you? Bryce.
[DENNIS] When you got to the Clubhouse, do you remember what happened next? A little.
Just tell us what you can.
[EXHALES] Um It's It's kind of a blur.
We we listened to music.
And then we, um, we started drinking and smoking pot.
So, do you remember these photos being taken? No.
[DENNIS] So you don't remember having sex with Bryce Walker? Um Chloe, you don't remember having sex with Bryce Walker? [CHLOE] No, I I do.
I remember.
You remember what? We had sex.
But you you don't remember Bryce asking for your consent, correct? No, I I do.
I remember that now.
We were drinking, so I had forgotten, but but I wanted to.
Well, God fucking damn it.
I believed her.
I think she told us the truth before she walked into that courtroom.
They got to her.
Somehow they got to her.
I don't know.
It's just been a few hours, and Warren's an ass, but he's a good lawyer, and he plays by the rules.
That family doesn't.
That boy doesn't.
And we just let him walk.
We can add them to the suit if you want to.
Or file separately.
I'm sure they'd settle before enduring another round of headlines.
Oh, Dennis.
I don't want Bryce Walker's money.
I want him dead.
[SCOFFS] ["FALLING IN DREAMS" PLAYING] If you were to tell me If I'd have had to guess I never would have told you If it is not a gift - I was left alone in the hot tub.
- I will not forget it But not for long.
- As long as I live - Because that's when you showed up, Bryce.
Please don't.
You got into the hot tub and turned off the jets.
Please.
I tried.
We tried, Hannah.
Hey.
You okay? - Seems to be the wisdom - I'm fine.
Conventional regret Solitary protest There's nothing to ingest It was all bullshit, wasn't it? I will not forget it - All that about taking back the power.
- As long as I live Big fucking deal.
We can spray paint some shit, they clean it up the next day.
That I cannot forgive Nothing does anything.
You wanna know what real power feels like? [GUNSHOTS] Oh! Oh, my This - This feels fucking incredible.
- Right? Told you.
It's your time [CLAY] Shit.
You're really good.
Just takes practice.
You know what really helps, though, is if you name your targets.
- [STAMMERING] Name them? - Yeah.
Like people you don't like or whatever.
Kind of helps you focus.
You know, do it all in your head.
Watch.
Bryce Walker.
Fuck, yeah! [CLAY EXHALES] [SIRENS APPROACHING] Shit.
Mr.
Barbour must've called the cops.
Clay, we gotta go.
You turned me around and pushed the full weight of your body into my back.
- Give me the gun.
- [HANNAH] I couldn't move.
- Clay.
- I had no power.
Jesus, Clay, give me the gun.
[SIREN WAILING] Just run! Oh, fuck.
[POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [LOCK RATTLING] [MR.
PORTER] Hmm.
[OLIVIA STAMMERS] This can't be the place, right? It's the building that she described.
Well [STAMMERING] No, there were other Polaroids of other girls.
There was proof.
You seem to be handling everything very well.
Ah, pretty exhausting day, I'm not gonna lie.
[CHUCKLES] That was a That was a whole thing.
You know, your father and I have always given you a lot of freedom, Bryce.
We've always trusted that you were responsible enough to make good decisions.
Seems like it's worked out pretty well so far.
I get to take care of myself, you get to keep up your tan year round.
Everybody wins, right? [NORA SCOFFS] What happened with Hannah? You were there yesterday.
I don't think we heard the whole story.
She came on to me.
We had sex.
I mean, I know you're aware I'm sexually active.
You've known since you walked in on me last year.
[NORA CLEARS HER THROAT] Turned and walked out and never said anything, but you saw a whole lot of naked.
And what happened with ChlÃe? A whole lot of naked there, too.
ChlÃe's got problems, okay? She comes from a broken home.
So you had sex with her when she was unconscious? I didn't force her to get drunk and stoned at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Oh, just like you didn't force Hannah to get into the hot tub with you.
Why do you care? You didn't even know Hannah.
Did you? Or was she just another thing that you wanted? You want to know what happened with me and Hannah, Mom? She got in the hot tub with me, no suit, just panties and a bra over those very nice tits.
And she looked at me like like she was hungry.
And, yeah, I wanted her.
I just I just had to have her.
So I took her, I turned her around, and I fucked her from behind.
Hard.
Until she cried.
Is that what you want to hear? You've brought shame on this family.
- You're a stranger in this house.
- [CHUCKLES] Always have been, Mom.
Is Mrs.
Baker coming back tonight? Nah, she's gone for the day.
Why don't you head home? I'll lock up.
Okay.
Thanks.
Oh, there was a package left for you earlier, on the counter.
- Who left it? - I don't know.
Just showed up.
[JUSTIN] It wouldn't have mattered if Chloe came through.
- Don't you dare blame Chloe.
- No, I know, I'm just saying She wasn't ready.
She wasn't strong enough to tell her story, - and that's not her fault.
- I know.
If she says it out loud, if she points at him and says, "He did this," her whole world comes crashing down.
Hasn't your whole world come crashing down? I wish I could fix this, Jess.
I would do anything to take everything you've been through, - and put it on me.
- You can't.
No, I can't.
But you can let me point at him and say, "He did this.
" ["THE KILLING MOON" PLAYING] Justin, it's me again.
I'm gonna need you to bring my car and meet me meet me at the bottom of Vaughan's Hill.
Um I got something I gotta do.
When I tried to climb out of the hot tub, you grabbed my arm.
You traced your fingers down my bra strap and over my bra.
I know.
I know.
I'm taking care of it.
You pulled my underwear down and used your body to keep me trapped there.
I was frozen.
I was terrified.

- [MONTGOMERY] Yeah, me, too.
[MEN SHOUTING IN VIDEO GAME] [GIRL GRUNTING] Who is it? [MONTGOMERY] Just Bryce fucking some chick in the hot tub.
Must be a desperate slut at this hour.
[MONTGOMERY] Yeah.
[SCOFFS] You could've stopped it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That night at the party.
Hannah and Bryce.
Please, Bryce.
Hannah's dead because of us.
[HANNAH GRUNTS] So, Hannah initiated this "on-again, off-again thing"? [BRYCE] Yes, she did.
She she took me to Hickman's Bridge.
[BRYCE] One wrong turn and you're plummeting down, down, down.
[CLAPS SOFTLY] Splat.
Game over.
Did you bring me here to murder me? [LAUGHS] No.
No, I just I just mean we take it for granted is all life and how precarious it is.
Coming here helps me step out of mine sometimes.
I think I get it.
We should, uh we should get back.
[BRYCE] Sometimes we just made out, um, looked at the stars.
Sometimes we made love.
[SIGHS] [HANNAH] Jeez, it's freezing in here.
- Does this place have any heat? - Oh, shit.
Uh, no.
Sorry.
Here, take this.
[LAUGHS] Isn't it, like, freedom, being on your own? Yeah, I guess.
I got plenty of freedom, though.
It'd be nice to have them show up every now and then.
That sounds kind of lonely.
Eh, sometimes, yeah.
I don't really talk about this stuff with a lot of people.
It's nice.
Yeah, it is.
That looks good on you.
Let me get a picture.
- Oh, no way.
No photos.
- What? Come on.
You're so beautiful.
Well, I probably shouldn't pose with this.
Don't want everyone to think the new girl is a complete stoner.
[LAUGHS] So, your parents, have you ever tried to have, like, a real conversation with them? Let them know how you feel about them being away all the time and everything? Whoa.
Um What's the matter? I thought we were having a good time.
We are.
It's just, um I like you, but as a friend.
[BRYCE] Yeah.
Okay, sure.
[SIGHS] [HANNAH GASPING] [BRYCE PANTING] Oh, yeah.
[HANNAH CRIES OUT] [CLAY] Why were you in the Clubhouse with him? When I tried to climb out of the hot tub, you pulled me back in.
Tell me, or I'll ask him myself.
You told me we were "just having fun.
" I'll make him hurt.
I'll make him understand what he did.
I struggled, but you were too strong for me.
You pulled my underwear down and used your body to trap me there.
Clay, what are you doing? Where did you get that? You gripped my wrists and pushed yourself inside of me.
- Get out of my way, Justin.
- Come on, Clay, this is fucking crazy.
It felt like a knife cutting me open.
No one's gonna get justice for her.
- Hey, come on.
Hey! - Move! I begged you, "Please, Bryce," but you told me to relax.
I talked to Jessica today.
She wants me to testify.
- Bullshit.
No, she doesn't.
- Yes, I swear, she does.
You said you would go "nice and easy," but you went harder and faster.
So you'll just run away or fucking overdose again? Clay, come on.
When I cried out in pain, you grabbed my hair like the sound of my pain made it better for you.
I can't count on anyone else anymore.
I have to do this myself.
You don't have to do this yourself.
We can get him tomorrow.
- I need to do it now.
- [JUSTIN] Why? I just tried to leave my body.
I tried to forget the anger and pain.
- For Hannah.
- [JUSTIN] Listen, Clay, I know you loved her, but she's gone.
And going in there and hurting Bryce now is not gonna bring her back.
She's gone.
[HANNAH] If you're lucky, you live a long life, and one day, your body just gives up, and it's over.
How do I make her stop? She won't stop.
Make who stop? Who, Clay? Who are you talking about? - There are two kinds of death.
- [JUSTIN] Clay! If you're not lucky, you die a little bit - [JUSTIN] Clay, come on.
- Over and over, until you realize it's too late.
- [SOBS] - [JUSTIN] Just stop.
Give me the gun.
What the fuck? And in that moment, it felt it felt like I was already dead.

Out of the trash can! Shut up! I did not! Want a sandwich? No.

I hate turkey.
Not hungry.
Come on, take the sandwich.
And I'll take half your Twinkies.
I don't got Twinkies.
Life is a dream drifting at sea Hey, those are mine! And now they're his.

And so, Titus would grow Tall and strong as an oak [JUSTIN] And friendship, it can be this really powerful thing.
- The fuck are you two doing? - Just hold on.
He's gonna keep doing it.
We have to stop him.
- Not like this.
- I'm calling the cops.
Just shut the fuck up and hold on, Bryce! It's never gonna get any better.
You were right to run away.
[JUSTIN] No, I wasn't.
That's why you came and got me, remember? - For Jess, for Hannah.
- Hannah wants him dead.
No, I don't think she does.
I don't think she wants to keep seeing people get hurt.
I don't.
Okay? This is fucking ridiculous.
You're gonna go back inside and you're gonna pour yourself another glass of whiskey, and you're gonna forget that we were ever here, got it? I heard they just filed for another additional witness.
That wouldn't be you by any chance, would it? You should be more scared than you are, Justin.
Bryce, I've got nothing left to lose.
That makes me the dangerous one.
[TIRES SQUEALING] What the fuck? What is it? We're being followed.
Are you sure? We'll lose him.
- Dude, it's a Prius.
- And I'm a fucking awesome driver.
[JUSTIN] And friendship is complicated.
You find yourself doing things you never thought you'd do.
[SIGHS] We're clear.
What the hell was that? Probably the person fucking with all of us.
- Bryce.
- It wasn't his car.
Well, one of his boys.
Because you're testifying.
Tomorrow.
You You're really gonna do it, right? Yeah.
[JUSTIN] Because friendship, you commit to it.

- [POUNDING ON DOOR] [ZACH] Alex! Alex! What? I'm awake.
Oh.
- Hey, guys.
- [ZACH] "Hey, guys"? Did you not hear us pounding on the door? I don't know.
I must've fallen asleep.

What is this? Do you know the damage these things can do to your health? The only damage they do is to the roof of your mouth, Mom.
Well, we're back to a healthy breakfast.
Zach, you're welcome to join.
What's the big emergency? This is what I woke up to this morning.
12:12 a.

"Someone gave me a bullet.
" 12:13 a.
m.
"Someone gave me a gun.
" 12:37 a.
m.
"I figured it all out.
" You can't fucking text shit like this to a person and then fall asleep.
Okay, I couldn't explain more because my thumbs got tired.
The last time you didn't respond to my texts or calls, you I know.
[SIGHS] [SIGHS] So, what the hell is going on? I know who's messing with us.
But I don't know where he is.
[MRS.
JENSEN] Good morning.
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Mrs.
Jensen, Mr.
Jensen.
What the hell happened to you two? - It was a fight.
- Sports.
Mine mine was a fight and his was sports.
I told Dad yesterday.
PE.
If someone's hurting you, we need to know what's going on.
Wait, wha What are you doing here? Well, um, I want to apologize that, uh, an argument that was largely between your father and me had the impact it did on the family.
And on you, Justin.
It wasn't fair.
I feel like I came here and messed everything up, so - No.
No, it's not - Justin, that's not what happened.
You didn't.
So, you just You're back? I'm back.
And I need to speak to Justin privately.
After breakfast.
I heard last night that you're going to testify today.
And while I like Dennis Vasquez very much, he does not represent your interests.
I wanna make sure that you understand everything that's at stake for you before you testify.
[STAMMERS] What do you mean? What's at stake? Clay, I don't want us to have secrets, but if I'm going to help Justin, that has to be between the two of us for now.
If he chooses to tell you after we talk, that's up to him.
Can you trust me? For now.
- [CLAY] Well, what did she tell you? - Nothing important.
Just walked me through how the day's gonna go.
- What did she say was at stake? - Mostly everything you already know.
Damn it.
- Do you know how to tie a tie? - Yes.
[SIGHS] I'm just nervous, okay? Oh, I guess [SIGHS] doing this sober is a lot harder than I thought it'd be.
And, you know, I'm gonna have to say stuff about me and Hannah.
Stuff that you don't you don't know.
We We didn't.
We never had sex or anything like that.
There's just more to the story.
I don't want you to start hating me again.
[CLAY SIGHS] Who said I stopped? Just don't lose your shit, okay? Man, you really freaked me out last night.
Where'd you get the gun? I borrowed it from a friend.
Well, give it back.
Yeah.
No, yeah, for sure.
- Jesus, how do you not know how? - [SCOFFS] I've seen you in a tie.
Last year at the winter dance.
Bryce used to tie them for me.
I never really learned how.
[HANNAH] I like the way you're taking care of Justin.
He really is just a sweet, injured boy.
Yeah, and girls are suckers for that.
You know, we're also suckers for the angry, vengeful hero types.
I was gonna kill him, Hannah.
I was ready to.
But is Justin right? Is that not what you want? I want you to forgive me.
But maybe that's the one thing in the world you won't do for me.
[DOOR OPENS] Your parents said we could drive together.
And they'll be right behind us in one of the other Priuses.
Jensen.
Look, I promise you, there's no box of pictures or anything like that.
This is just fucking Zach making shit up to make me look bad.
- What happened that night? - It was your idea to have an audience.
No one forced you to get stoned out of your mind.
I even warned you not to hit that shit.
What about Hickman's Bridge? - I thought that was our place.
- Is that why you walked out? Jesus.
ChlÃe, seriously? It's not like I grill you about every guy you hooked up with before me, do I? - Where's the trust? - What was I supposed to do? Not walk out.
Not testify against me.
You thought that was gonna make you feel better? Do you really think anyone's gonna trust you after that? [DOOR OPENS] [MS.
CHILDS] Okay, time for disciplinary matters.
[DENNIS] If we're going to establish a pattern of behavior, your testimony needs to contradict his claim that he's never forced himself on another student.
Okay.
It all comes down to whether the jury believes you, so Ms.
Struhl is gonna do whatever she can to discredit you on the cross.
She's gonna bring up everything.
Do you understand? - Yeah, I understand.
- Justin, you can't do this halfway.
If you leave them any room to doubt you, they will.
Bryce fooled them yesterday.
Yeah, I'll do my best, Mrs.
Baker.
Has someone threatened you about your testimony? The bruises on your face, did Bryce do that? No.
Are you afraid of him? Not a goddamn bit.
[DOOR OPENS] - What the fuck did you do, man? - Whoa, what's wrong? What's wrong? - This is wrong.
- What? Now they'll know we're not weak.
It's totally punk, right? It's not punk.
It's It's fucking stupid! - We're in so much trouble right now.
- Who cares? Fuck the system.
"Fuck the" My dad is gonna kill me.
He won't.
Your dad's cool.
Not with me getting expelled.
Okay, so we'll get expelled together.
- [SCOFFS] - It doesn't have to stop us.
Stop us from doing what? From bringing down the system.
Those guns? I have more.
We can really make shit happen.
Like you said, we can end those motherfuckers.
Dude, that was just me saying shit.
That was just me talking, man.
Are you serious right now? What the fuck is wrong with you? I'll tell them it was all me.
I'll do whatever you want.
No, no, it's fine.
We're good.
Um I think, you know, we shouldn't hang out until this thing blows over.
Are we still friends? Totally.
[JUSTIN] Being friends with him, it was about loyalty.
But it was also about fear.
[DENNIS] And how would you describe Mr.
Walker's relationships with girls? - Were they fear-based as well? - Yes, sir.
They were like conquests to him.
He would always brag about what he'd done with girls.
And then he'd call them sluts for hooking up with him.
And did he ever mention an "on again, off again" relationship - with Hannah Baker to you? - No, sir, because it never happened.
Maybe they hung out, but there's no way he would've hooked up with her and not told me about it.
Because he liked to brag, as you said? Exactly.
How would you describe Hannah? She was really kind and funny.
- Ah! [GIGGLES] - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [JUSTIN] I liked her from the first time I saw her.
We only had one real date, but it was it was nice.
[MRS.
FOLEY] Fuck you! [JUSTIN] I walked her home, then I went home.
But I couldn't sleep.
[SETH] Yes, I got you.
Okay.
- [MRS.
FOLEY SCREAMING] - [OBJECTS THUDDING] [SETH] Why don't you take care of that? Why don't [JUSTIN] And I got in, like, a fight with my mom's boyfriend.
- [OBJECTS CRASHING] - [SETH] Oh, yeah.
[JUSTIN] I texted Hannah, and she said to come over.
Jesus.
Are you sure you don't want me to call someone? Yeah.
It'll run its course.
Seth will get sick of my mom.
He'll eventually take off.
They usually do.
And what if he doesn't? Then it gives me more of a reason to escape to your house, right? - Thanks, by the way.
- Oh, sure.
[SIGHS] So, uh, this is my room.
I was kind of saving it for our third or fourth date, but Shit.
[LAUGHS] I usually try to save the whole "my mom's an addict" thing till the fourth date, too, so Sorry.
Hmm.
You got Here, let me Let me get you a washcloth.
Oh, my God.
[BOTH LAUGHING] - Amazing, right? - Mmm.
Feel free to pass out.
You know, the body, after stress, just sometimes shuts down.
[JUSTIN] She just let me sleep there all night.
She slept on her own floor.
Coast is clear.
Front door, bottom of the stairs.
- Okay.
Sorry.
- Yeah.
Do you wanna do this again sometime? [BOTH CHUCKLING] - Call it date five? - Sure.
Sure.
[BOTH CHUCKLING] - Bye.
- Bye.
[EXHALES] [CAR HONKS] - Why no ride this morning? - What's up, man? I figured I'd walk.
You're walking from the completely wrong direction.
Whose bed did you wake up in? [LAUGHS] [JUSTIN] I knew Bryce wasn't gonna leave it alone.
- Justin.
- Get off me, man.
[JUSTIN] I knew I'd have to tell him something.
I don't know why that was more important to me than doing right by Hannah.
- Picture's worth a thousand words.
- Oh! [LAUGHS] [JUSTIN] Friendship, I guess.
Being a man.
Wanting him to think I was more than I was somehow.
Oh, yeah, we're sending that shit around.
No, no, Bryce, stop.
Seriously, hey! Maybe Bryce sent it around because he was jealous.
Or maybe because he's just cruel.
I don't know.
I don't know why people send around photos like that.
Bryce did shi Stuff like that all the time.
What is the one thing I told you about that place? The one thing.
Be responsible.
You represent this team.
The team is my priority.
Now, I got lawyers talking to me about a search warrant and that drugstore being vandalized a couple nights ago.
You wouldn't know anything, would you? No.
I never go near that store.
This lawyer thinks there's a whole box of these Polaroids out there somewhere.
I don't wanna know if that's true.
I don't wanna know why you would take the goddamn pictures in the first place.
I just don't wanna hear any more about it.
Are we understood? We are.
Tell me what you saw when you went back into the room that night.
We'll renew our objection.
Irrelevant and inflammatory.
We're establishing that Bryce Walker engaged in a pattern of behavior and that the school was aware.
The defense claims no such behavior took place.
We have a right to respond.
Witness will answer.
[STAMMERS] I went back into the room.
Jessica was passed out and Bryce was standing over her, and his his pants were unzipped.
And she had her panties off and she wasn't moving.
Her eyes were closed.
It It was like she was dead.
I tried to pull him off, but he shoved me out and locked the door.
I just sat there listening.
Listening to him and her.
It It sounded like she started to wake up.
Did you think of calling the police or calling for help? I did.
I - But I was afraid.
- Afraid of what? I don't know.
Afraid of losing my best friend.
My girlfriend.
My entire life.
Which I guess I already lost.
I'll regret this forever.
- What's up? - So they don't know about yesterday, but he missed the first three periods today.
- How'd you get that out of Ms.
Douglas? - It's the cane, dude.
Told her that he was supposed to help me with PT.
But I help you with that.
Clearly it was a lie, Zach.
Oh, my God.
What's next? We need Clay and Tony.
So, you were intoxicated at this party, is that correct? Yes.
And you would regularly get drunk at parties, isn't that true? Yeah, I guess, sometimes.
And you're a habitual user of heroin, isn't that correct? Objection.
Relevance? Goes to capacity and reliability, Your Honor.
Overruled.
[SONYA] Justin, you're a heroin addict, isn't that correct? I wasn't then.
I'm in recovery.
And on the night in question, you brought Jessica upstairs with the intention of having sex with her, correct? I thought it might go there.
And you never actually saw Bryce and Jessica during intercourse, correct? - I heard noises.
- Noises that could have been sounds of two very drunk teenagers having sex, correct? No.
Jessica was passed out.
She couldn't She couldn't speak.
She couldn't speak when you left her.
I literally just left the room.
[SONYA] And when you entered the room, you saw Bryce standing over her, not on top of her, correct? - Yeah, but he shoved me out.
- Mr.
Foley, isn't it true that you never saw Bryce assault anyone? - No, that's not true.
- Isn't it true that you concocted this rape story to save yourself from the embarrassment of what really happened? Your girlfriend cheated on you with your best friend.
- No.
- Objection.
And isn't it true that you left town rather than face the truth? - No.
- You didn't leave town? I mean, I left town, but it was not to avoid any And wasn't the heroin also a way to avoid the truth? - Objection.
- And aren't you lying now? - No! - Asked and answered.
No, I'm telling the truth, I He raped her.
I'm telling the truth.
[CLAY] The jury's not buying it.
We have to go after him.
And we need those pictures.
- Who would know where he is? - And why would they tell us? [BAILIFF] Two minutes.
Two minutes, please.
I know who to ask.
In the first few years of life, children rely on their parents.
But there comes a time when every parent must share their child with the world, with a school.
In the hands of the faculty at Liberty High School, Hannah Baker was bullied and harassed.
And she asked for help twice.
First, anonymously through a letter read aloud in class but ultimately ignored by her teacher.
And then Hannah did what most students who are suffering do not.
She went to her school counselor.
And she suggested that she had been raped by a fellow student.
She went to a mandatory reporter for help.
And yet again, her cries were ignored.
Hannah may have been a complicated girl, as the defense has suggested, but this case is simple.
Hannah Baker asked for help, and Liberty High School failed to provide it.
[MR.
BOLAN] We've already spoken to Cyrus and his father.
Did he tell you it was his idea? He said he was worried you might do something more serious.
- What's more serious than this? - Tyler is a good boy.
Well, yes, he has been, Mrs.
Down, but he's also been very involved in a number of our challenges of late.
[MRS.
DOWN STAMMERS] This is about those tapes? No, no.
It's about felony vandalism.
I understand it's difficult to hear these things when your child has not shown a tendency towards rule-breaking in the past, but this is the reality that we find ourselves in now.
And I think our best hope is to address it head-on.
[MR.
DOWN] Meaning? We've decided to refer Tyler to a diversionary program.
This is a program for kids who need a kind of behavioral guidance so that they don't end up in legal trouble.
And once he completes the program satisfactorily, he of course will be welcome back at Liberty.
What about the other boy? [MR.
BOLAN] Cyrus is gonna be suspended for a period of time.
[MR.
DOWN] How is that fair? He did come to us voluntarily to confess, and he's been very forthcoming.
Well, Tyler will be forthcoming.
Tyler, tell him the truth.
He's not interested in the truth, Mom.
If he did, half the jocks would be at his stupid diversionary program.
[MR.
DOWN] Tyler.
They just beat the shit out of kids in the hallway and nothing happened.
No one does anything.
Many factors contributed to Hannah Baker's suicide.
Some of which we may never know.
But here is what we do know.
She never reported any of her conflicts with students and she never said she was raped.
Her parents never reached out to the school for any reason.
Hannah was a troubled girl with issues at home, a family history of mental health concerns, and evidence of low self-esteem.
This was a tragedy.
A promising young life lost.
But school faculty cannot go home with their students.
I'll leave you with this question.
When do we hold the parents responsible? So no one has seen that fucking box? Guys, if those pictures end up with the wrong person, I'm-I'm done.
We're all fucking done.
Dude, some of those pictures are just like partying or whatever.
You think that fucking matters? We're all in this together now.
[JUSTIN] The truth is Bryce was never my friend.
Because he doesn't know what friendship is.
[DOOR CLOSES] Tyler.
Don't talk to my son.
- Look, Tyler is a great kid.
- Yes.
And he managed to stay out of trouble until he met your son.
His anger needs to be dealt with.
Now, both of my kids have seen a therapist since the divorce.
Aw, you see a shrink.
How punk rock.
- Shut your mouth.
You know nothing.
- Cyrus.
- I know you're a sellout and a narc.
- Yeah? Mm-hmm.
- And a fucking poser! - Hey! - [MRS.
DOWN] What is your problem? - Let's go! [GASPS] Mom, they're calling him a drug addict.
All they keep talking about is how he went missing and him and Bryce had a falling-out.
They're not even God, they're missing the point.
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.
I know that you had high hopes for Justin.
- But he's a troubled kid.
- We're all troubled kids.
Oh, I know.
Should he try talking to the police as well? There's still a criminal case to be made.
No.
No, that wouldn't do any good.
Because you still don't remember? Mom, you've seen what they've done to Hannah in that courtroom.
And look what happened to ChlÃe.
I I don't wanna end up back in there.
I don't wanna be on trial.
[JUSTIN] There should be some things more important than friendship.
- Things you just won't do for a friend.
- [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - Hey, Scotty.
- Bryce is looking for you.
You didn't tell him about this place, did you? No, I told you, I never would.
But who are you hiding from this time? My dad's on a fucking tear, man.
Came after me with a hammer.
So, a few days in the hobo hotel.
- And how come you're here? - I'm not a rapist, Monty.
[SCOFFS] Okay.
And I'm sick of people assuming I am.
Look, we've been taking care of Bryce for too long, man.
- Come on, enough's enough.
- Okay, so what do you want me to do? Give us the Polaroids back.
- What the fuck, Scotty? - They told me what you've been doing.
Wait, you're the one who fucking narc'd about the Clubhouse? Nope.
I did.
Oh, right.
Of course you did.
Fuck this.
I'm out.
What's the matter, Monty? You scared? We know what you did.
Running me off the road? - The target.
- Dead rat.
- My fucking car.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Give us the pictures and we'll let you go.
You'll let me go? Or what, you're gonna hit me with your cane again? - Oh, shit.
- Whoa.
Hey, Alex.
- Alex, where'd you get that gun? - Monty gave it to me.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah, I'll give you the Polaroids.
And then I'm clean.
That's the deal.
Fine.
So hand them over.
- I have to get them.
They're not here.
- I'll go with you.
- Alex.
- No.
I go with him.
[DOOR OPENS] [MR.
BOLAN] Kevin.
So, uh, the district has completed its review, and, uh, they've decided to terminate your employment.
Effective immediately.
[CHUCKLES] [GRUNTS, SIGHS] [BOOKS THUDDING] Anything else? If there's anything I can do Well, that's very nice.
Thank you.
You know what you can do? You can do more.
These kids, they deserve better than what we're offering.
- Well, our per-student spending, it's - Save the talking points.
You pay that fucker, Coach Rick, two times more than you pay any counselor.
I made a mistake.
A terrible, tragic mistake.
[SIGHS] And maybe I wasn't trained well enough for the job that I was asked to do.
Maybe I didn't fit in here either.
Well, I'll take the blame.
But who's gonna take the blame next time? I hope there won't be a next time.
I hope so, too, but there's always a next time.
These kids, I flagged as most critical.
They need your attention every week, if not every day.
Or there will be a next time.
[DOOR CLOSES] [JUSTIN] I held onto my friendship with Bryce because I didn't think I had anything else.
You went a long way for Bryce.
He'd sell you out to save his own ass in a heartbeat.
- You know that, right? - Know what I got, Alex? I got my friends, I got the team.
That's it.
I don't get to be all sad.
Boo-hoo, my friend died.
I'm gonna put a bullet in my head so the world feels sorry for me.
Jesus, you wave that gun around like I give a shit.
I don't, man.
If I sell out Bryce or lie, either way, my whole life falls apart.
I got no one else on my side.
I can't run home.
That team's my home.
Going to playoffs, winning state, being an athlete, that's not about fun for me.
It's about survival.
It's all I got.
It's everything.
So you wanna shoot me? Shoot me.
- Where are the pictures? - Man, I don't know.
I don't have them.
- What? - I said what I did to get out of there.
'Cause you're not gonna shoot me, Alex.
You can't even shoot yourself.
Fuck you! By the time you get anywhere, I'll be long gone.
Is he really worth it? You're the one with the hole in your head.
You tell me.
[CAR ENGINE STARTS] [JUSTIN] I thought Bryce was all I had.
I've texted you, like, 20 times.
Oh.
Missed it, I guess.
[SIGHS] I just got a warning.
I told them I should get suspended.
That nothing was your fault.
Are you okay? [CHLOE SIGHS] You feel safe with me, right? Of course I do.
And you believe me? - Bryce - Do you believe me? Yes or no? I believe you.
I'm I'm a good person.
I know you are.
Do you? - You really think that? - Yes.
That's why I'm here.
You know I love you, right? I know.
Tell me you love me.
I do.
I love you.
Good.
[DOORBELL RINGS] [JUSTIN] But real friends will give you the bad news.
- Okay, don't freak out.
- Don't start that way and I won't.
- Monty doesn't have the pictures.
- What? And he lied to us and he ditched me.
- And I'm so sorry.
- [JESSICA SIGHS] I so wanted the pictures to be the answer.
I tried, Jess.
I really tried.
I only wanted this to be okay for you and to never have to think about it again.
I know.
And this is not our place to say.
I get that.
And And we shouldn't even be here.
But, look, it's different now.
With those pictures out there somewhere, all those girls need someone to stand up for them.
We don't have the pictures, so we need you.
[ALEX] And we get that you're afraid that people won't believe you or that they'll come after you, and that is so fair.
But we just wanted you to know that we'll stand by you.
We believe you.
All of us.
Six months ago, I told you I'd burn Hannah's tapes for you, and you told me not to.
Because you knew her story needed to be heard.
And so does yours.
And you don't have to be afraid anymore.
And as lonely as it is, you'll never be alone.
I told him not to say that because it's cheesy.
- [LAUGHS] - [ALEX] But the point is whenever you're ready, we are, too.
If I do this, everything changes.
Maybe it needs to change.
[DEPUTY STANDALL] How could you tell he was assaulting her? [JUSTIN] I could tell because he was standing over her.
- He was just standing over her? - No.
Well, you gotta be clear about this, son.
He was on top of her, and his his penis was out and he was hard.
She wasn't moving.
[JESSICA] I, um I remember seeing him on top of me.
I remember feeling his body crushing me.
I remember him holding me down and forcing himself on me.
I remember his face.
It was It was Bryce Walker.
[INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR OPENS] I'm so proud of you.
[LAUGHS] Thank you.
I never liked you.
- I know.
- And I can never forgive you.
Dad, be nice.
Despite everything, I thank you for your courage and wish you children of your own someday so you'll know what it's like to wanna save them from the world.
[JUSTIN] The thing we're all most afraid of is losing our friends, is being all alone.
[TONY] I couldn't wait for the verdict, so I came to help you with the store.
You know, I didn't realize that, ah, these things move.
They flipped over everything.
All the shelves, the computers in the back.
Still, everything's done and pretty much back in place.
Olivia.
I wonder how long it's been back there.
[SIGHS] It still smells like her.
The jury's gonna do the right thing.
I know they will.
- [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] - [MAN] No! No! Not you! [WHIMPERS] Not my beloved bride! [WOMAN GROANS] I'm sorry! - [FILM CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] - This is a zombie movie.
Yes.
You hate zombie movies.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Yes.
But I couldn't just sit around waiting for the jury to come back.
And it was this, or a romantic comedy, or a cancer movie, or something French, so We used to judge people who came to the movies alone.
Well, I'm not alone, am I? I think zombies just really wanna be loved.
That's ridiculous.
Zombies wanna eat brains.
That's it.
Period.
No deeper meaning, no metaphor for human existence, nothing.
Except the dead come back to life.
[CHUCKLES] I can't forgive you, Hannah.
I can't ever forgive you.
I was just gonna walk away, so you didn't have to.
What made you think I was gonna walk away? - Don't you think you should? - No.
I mean, the man was in a coma.
For days.
[CLICKS TONGUE] I know.
When I saw him the other night, I panicked and ran away.
[BOTH SIGH] I'm done running.
And if you're gonna know me, then you need to know all of me.
Yeah.
Well, thank you.
[TONY SIGHS] My dad got me into boxing.
And I was a fighter long before I figured out I was gay.
After I figured out I was gay, I was glad I was a boxer.
I hear that.
And I was glad I was past the point that my dad could scare the shit out of me.
'Cause I didn't ever wanna be scared again.
Especially of someone that I love.
[CELL PHONE BUZZING] It's a backup date? It's the verdict.
I gotta go.
[SPOON TAPPING] [CELL PHONE DINGS] [BAILIFF] All rise.
The Honorable Judge Martin Campbell presiding.
[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] Be seated.
Bailiff, bring in the jury, please.
[DOOR OPENS] Madam Forewoman, have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor.
[INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [JUDGE] What say you? [FOREWOMAN] We the jury, in the case of Andrew and Olivia Baker versus the Evergreen County School District, find the defendant not responsible.
[PEOPLE MURMURING] - [GAVEL POUNDING] - [JUDGE] Come to order.
Thank you, litigators, and thank you, jury, for your patience, deliberation, and service during this proceeding.
- This court is adjourned.
- [GAVEL POUNDS] [CHATTER] My daughter wasn't the perfect victim.
There's no such thing.
- [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] - Hannah was a beautiful young woman.
Full of life, and dreams, and passions, and fears, and failings like any other teenage girl.
And we let her down.
And people wanna point to the parents, but we didn't allow her to be bullied, and we didn't send her away when she came and asked for help, and we didn't send her back to class with her rapist.
Boys bullied her and adults allowed it.
You know, I don't know a single woman who hasn't faced sexual assault, abuse, or worse.
Not one.
Many survive.
My daughter didn't, and that's not her fault.
Obviously, we are very disappointed with today's verdict.
We presented a case that we believe in.
But despite today's outcome, we hope we've sent a message to all schools - that they must do better - [DOOR OPENS] and that this cannot happen again.
- Students deserve to feel safe.
- [CLAY] Fucking Bryce.
[DENNIS] We hope in the near future - Bryce Walker? - Yes, sir? You're under arrest for felony sexual assault.
- Excuse me - No.
You can see him at the station.
- Clear a path, please.
- [DEPUTY 1] Clear a path.
[DEPUTY 2] Let's go, folks.
We need to get through.
You're making a big fucking mistake.
- Justin Foley, you're under arrest - What? As an accessory to felony sexual assault.
Clay, what's going on? Justin Mom? Mom? Justin! Wait, no.
- Jess, it's okay.
- What? It's okay.
[JUSTIN] Friendship is about sacrifice.
- Mom, they-they arrested Justin.
- I know, honey.
Justin knew that was a risk, going on record about what happened.
Mom, he He saved my life.
All right? We have to help him.
We will.
I promise.
Jessica.
We got him.
We got Bryce.
But they got Justin, too.
What do we do? [SOBS] You keep fighting.
["WHAT WENT DOWN" PLAYS] I buried my heart In a hole in the ground With the lights and the roses And the cowards downtown They threw me a party There was no one around They tried to call my girl But she could not be found [ROSS BUTLER] For help finding crisis resources, visit 13reasonswhy.

1 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CLAY] I thought a long, long time about what to say today.
How to pay tribute, but also tell the truth.
It truly hurts me to think that my actions have caused anyone emotional distress.
When I think of the pain that I may have caused, I-I just Well, I feel awful.
Every day, I wish that I could go back in time.
I was used to a certain culture of partying and hookups, and many of us never questioned it, but it is time to question it.
And I know that I need to be the one to set an example.
I'm I'm trying every day to be a better man, to be the man that my parents raised me to be.
And to be a positive influence at Liberty High.
It is my sincerest hope that you will allow me to do so.
Thank you, sir.
- Does the county accept the allocution? - We do, Your Honor.
Prior to sentencing, the victim would like to exercise her right to make her own statement.
Proceed.
[CLAY] I have to admit, when I was asked to speak today, I didn't want to.
To stand up in front of all these people.
But it's what Hannah deserves.
Your Honor, thank you for this opportunity to address the court.
If it's all right, for the first part of my statement, I'd like to address the defendant directly.
- [JUDGE] Go right ahead.
- Why not? The first weekend in September, my parents were out of town and my little brothers were at their grandparents'.
I wanted to host a party like I thought a popular cheerleader should.
My boyfriend was there.
Your friend Justin.
We had been drinking.
We decided to go up to my room.
I remember making out with him.
And then I [INHALES] And then I started to fall asleep or or pass out.
I just I remember thinking that I just needed to close my eyes for a few minutes.
Then he Then he walked out of the room.
And then I remember waking up to you pulling off my underwear.
I remember feeling you push yourself inside of me.
[SNIFFLES] I may not remember all of the details, but I will never forget the sheer terror of feeling your weight on top of me, of not being able to breathe.
When I opened my eyes, I was alone in the hot tub with him, and there was The way he looked at me, there was something in his eyes.
And I was afraid.
I wanted to slow down, but he told me not to be a tease.
And he pushed me down on the couch and said he was glad I had waited for him.
And then he pulled off my jeans and then my underwear.
And he said that if I showed my body better, people wouldn't think I was a lesbian.
He used a different word.
And then he grabbed me on the inside of my thigh.
At that moment, we were left alone, and he picked me up.
He just picked me up and carried me behind the fence.
And he lay down on top of me and started to take my pants off.
I fought and I fought, but he was 18 and I was 12.
I found out later this guard had a reputation.
When he got up from my bed and left, my roommate rolled over and told me it happened to most of the girls.
I was a second-year associate.
He invited me to a strategy meeting in his hotel room.
He answered the door in his bathrobe.
I spent the evening insisting we work on the case.
At the end of that year, I was let go.
I had been babysitting for this family for, I guess, two years.
He was my youth pastor.
My second cousin.
Your Honor, when we leave this courtroom, Bryce Walker gets to leave convinced that he chose the wrong girl to have sex with.
I get to leave constantly looking over my shoulder for monsters dressed up as the popular kid, constantly on edge and assuming the worst in every boy.
The sentence you decide today can tell Bryce Walker what he did was wrong.
It can say that to every boy, every man who behaves like he does.
And it can say to victims like me that our story matters.
Thank you.
Prosecution has put forth a sentencing recommendation.
Does the defense have anything to contribute? Your Honor, this is a terribly unfortunate event.
And two young lives have been changed forever.
Bryce has lost all his scholarship offers.
The school district has cancelled what might well have been a championship season.
There is regret on all sides.
We urge the court to let these two young people start rebuilding and return to their lives.
This is a tragedy all around.
As a judge, it's my role to look at both sides.
And California law requires every judge to consider rehabilitation and probation for first-time offenders.
I'd like to see these two young people look hard at their lives and their choices.
But I don't want to do any further damage.
Mr.
Walker I expect you to walk the straight and narrow.
I'm sentencing you to three months probation.
So ordered.
- [GAVEL POUNDS] - Your Honor, three months probation? - [JUDGE] That's all.
- [GAVEL POUNDS] [CLAY] I'm angry.
I'm sad.
And I still have no idea how what happened happened.
Talk to me about the sex doll that was found at Ms.
Davis' home.
Or the dead rat that was inside Mr.
Dempsey's locker.
The vandalism to Mr.
Padilla's car.
This is bullshit.
What about the shooting target you sent my son? I didn't do any of that.
We have several kids who say he intimidated witnesses, engaged in felony vandalism.
Everyone's saying all kinds of shit, but it's not true.
Where's the gun? I never touched a gun in my life.
Your Honor, Bryce Walker was released on bail within hours of his arrest, and Justin has been stranded in juvenile detention for almost a month.
[JUDGE] I'm aware of the timeline.
The related case is complete as of today.
Justin's plea is in, the paperwork is done.
Understood, Counselor, but as a minor, he has to be released into custody.
We have been searching for Amber Foley for weeks, Your Honor.
- She's nowhere to be found.
- Keep looking.
Until then, he's remanded.
Bailiff? [DOOR OPENS] Hang on, Justin.
We're working on it.
I know.
Thank you.
[CLAY] We're still learning all the ways we've been changed.
All the things we've lost.
I'm so fucking sorry.
It's insane.
But somehow I still feel stronger.
[DOOR CLOSES] Wait, where's Justin? They'll only release him to a guardian, and the judge won't move on it.
We've filed emergency papers, but it's a 24-hour minimum.
I'll take the petition to Purdy.
He owes us.
Do you wanna start on the order for the school? Yeah.
We're asking for a court order to force the school to protect you.
To keep him away from you.
Thank you.
Mom, is your firm I mean, are they cool with this? I've left the firm to work with Dennis on cases like this.
Oh, that's That's cool.
[BRYCE SIGHS] [CLAY] We're just starting to figure out how to go on with our lives.
Coach said we could leave our lockers till the end of the year.
I'm transferring.
To Hillcrest.
Hillcrest? You got the grades for that? Not exactly.
Well, private schools need fields, too, I guess.
Yeah.
And uniforms and all that shit.
- [BAG ZIPS] - Speaking of which not all of my credits transferred, so I'll be going in as a junior.
Which means I'll see you on the field this fall.
They're letting you play football? That's right.
See you at the dance.
Wait.
So, you and Chloe? Yeah.
Loyalty.
It's a thing, huh? Take care of yourself, Zachy.
[CLAY] I say "go on" and not "move on" because in some ways we'll never completely move on from what happened.
Your meeting with the district psychologist went well and the reports from your diversion program are excellent.
It was a good program.
Tell me why.
Um, well, at first, it was very difficult.
You know, the long hikes and the camping.
But after a few days, with everything else stripped away, you're just left to your thoughts and you learn things.
And what did you learn? That I can choose how I respond to things.
That even if I am feeling angry, or lonely, or whatever, that I'm in control of my own actions.
I can't control what other people do, but I can control my response.
Do you think you're ready to come back? Do you think things will be different? Yeah, I think so.
I'm ready.
Principal Bolan is concerned that we keep a very close eye on you.
I understand.
And your return won't be easy.
No, I know.
[CHATTER] Hey.
Hi! Hi.
[GIGGLES] Hey.
- You're back! - I am.
- Wow.
You look good.
- Thanks.
Yeah, apparently, natural sunlight and physical exercise are, like, good for us or something.
- Something.
[CHUCKLES] - Something.
The good news is that I'm back in time for the Spring Fling.
And I was determined to make it back in time to take you.
- Oh.
- I mean, or we could just blow it off.
- We could do something else.
- Yeah, no, I mean I'm-I'm going to the dance, uh, with Eric.
Okay.
Oh.
- Cool.
- Yeah.
We're kinda dating.
Just for, like, a few weeks now.
Yeah, cool.
You know, he's Eric's a good guy, so Yeah, that's cool.
- [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] - Yeah.
- Shoot.
I gotta run.
- Yeah, me, too.
I'm really glad you're back.
Thanks.
Glad to be back.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What's up, man? [CLAY] And I don't say "get back to normal" because life will never be normal again.
Before we start, I am distrustful of religion.
Okay.
The service can be whatever you want it to be.
It's just my mother always told us we should abide, and have faith, accept what's coming to us.
And I think that teaches people to be passive.
I think abiding and acceptance is bullshit.
- Excuse my language.
- I don't disagree.
So tell me, w-why choose a church for Hannah's service? We, uh we both come from religious families, and it's something we drifted from a bit, and thought maybe it was something Hannah perhaps should have had in her life.
We were ashamed.
[SIGHS] We were ashamed to have a funeral.
Or a service.
But then, after everything that happened, if there is a God, I want Him to see that my little girl deserves His care.
He will.
He'll see that.
[MR.
BAKER] A few of the other places we called, [SIGHS] given the circumstances of Hannah's death Let me assure you there's no judgment from me.
Not regarding Hannah's decision or the circumstances that led her there.
And I hope one day you'll release yourselves from any shame you might still be feeling as well.
[CLAY] Life is divided into "Hannah" and "after Hannah.
" [CLAY] I don't have anything to compare it to.
I've lived here all my life.
It's like asking Han Solo, "How is space?" Wow.
You're an actual nerd, aren't you? I admire that.
There's courage in being a nerd.
[CAR HORN HONKING] ["LOVELY" PLAYING] [CLAY] Memories are sometimes a relief.
And sometimes they're torture.
[HANNAH] I was right.
You're the most courageous nerd I ever knew.
They asked me to speak.
At your service.
Are you gonna do it? I don't know what to say.
Or if I can trust myself not to be angry.
So, be angry.
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone Or if I can say what I really need to say.
I think you can.
[CLAY] But we hold on to the memories [TATTOO MACHINE BUZZING] because they're what we have left.
You're doing great this time.
You can look now.
No more comma.
Thank you.
[CLAY] And we have an urge to remember, to commemorate another time, to hold on to this as long as we can.
The thing I'm most afraid of is forgetting you.
Then don't.
The thing I'm second most afraid of is I'll never be able to let you go.
Do you remember the winter dance? Not the slow dance, but that song where we jumped around like idiots and looked like fools.
Like absolute dorks.
Yeah.
[CHUCKLES] Why? No reason.
I just wanted you to think of that right now.
Heart made of glass My mind of stone Tear me to pieces, skin to bone Hello, welcome home [CLAY] But today we begin to let go.
We're here to say goodbye to Hannah.
One act does not define a life.
We celebrate the richness of her life, even as the tragic circumstances of her death cannot be forgotten.
[ANDY] It does my heart good to see so many of Hannah's friends here today.
Hannah had the biggest heart, which she so generously shared with all of us.
So, please, be kind to each other.
She dreamed of going to New York to become a writer.
I'm not sure when that dream began to feel impossible to her.
Hannah was my dream.
And now I get to dream for Hannah as well as for myself.
And so do all of you.
So, please, dream your dreams.
And dream them for Hannah, and don't let anyone take them away from you.
Don't ever let them go.
Hannah Baker came into my life at the end of one summer like a star that fell to Earth.
Like nothing I had seen, like no one I had ever met.
She was funny, and smart, and moody, and and maddening, and beautiful.
And I loved her.
I loved her so much.
And I ask her every day why she did what she did.
But I get no answers.
She took those with her when she went.
Leaving me, all of us, angry, empty, confused.
And I know that hurt won't ever go away.
But there will come a day when I don't feel it every minute.
And the anger won't be so hot, and the other feelings will fade, and I'll be left with only love.
A good friend once said to me, "I can love you and still let you go.
" So, Hannah, I love you, and I let you go.
And I miss you.
And I hope that wherever you go next, you feel peace, you feel safe in a way that you never did here.
Wherever you go next, I hope you know that I love you.
[PEOPLE SNIFFLING, COUGHING] [BELL TOLLING] [CHATTER] Everything okay? Yeah.
No, I just, um - I was just taking a minute.
- Of course.
I'll leave you to it.
Can I ask you do you believe in the immortal soul? I do.
And do you think Hannah is going to hell because she killed herself? I don't.
I think the God I believe in, a just God, would have mercy on a soul like hers.
And if God forgives her, we should.
I believe we should follow His example, sure, but it's not always easy.
And do you think Does God forgive us? The people who let her down? I think He does.
Clay, you don't have to believe in the immortal soul to believe that people live on with us.
Wait, what do you mean? Just that we've lost Hannah, but not the things she gave us.
Compassion, understanding, love.
Those don't go away.
["THE HEALING" PLAYING] Calm down Let the world spin around There ain't no other place [CLAY] How do we take care of ourselves and look after each other? And celebrate Hannah's life and let it remind us to hold on to each other and to the precious time we have? Do you remember when we first met you? At that table over there? You thought we were crazy.
No.
I was just, like, terrified and amazed.
I mean, you guys were fearless.
I don't remember being fearless.
[CHUCKLES] This is, um This is really inappropriate at a wake, especially given the whole history, but I've been I've been trying for, like, two weeks now to get up the nerve to ask you, um if you would wanna go to the Spring Fling as, like, people who date? Because I think that we are now, but I'm not really sure.
Um [STAMMERS] I think we are.
Yeah? I mean, I'm not sure how ready I am to be a person who dates, but I mean, we are.
- So, yes.
- Yeah? - Yes.
[LAUGHS] - Okay.
Oh, God.
Is it okay that I asked you out at Hannah's table? Oh, it's all of our table.
And I think she'd be okay with it.
She'd probably make you interpret some weird painting.
Yeah, who picks the paintings? [ZACH] Yo, dude! [LAUGHS] Oh, my God, you're crushing me! [CHUCKLES] You're, like, down to nothing.
We gotta get you on a program.
Okay, sure.
How the fuck did Bryce only get three months and you got six? Aren't you pissed? I guess I just wasn't surprised.
Actually, I'm gonna take a gap year.
I'm going to Europe.
Which, I know, sounds like a clichÃ©, but, honestly, Asia is the clichÃ©.
I mean, I could be going to Goa, but I'm not.
I'm old school.
I've actually been thinking about doing some traveling myself.
Oh, my God, you should.
You so should.
[COURTNEY] It's annoying how smart she is.
I don't like it when people are smarter than me.
But it's fine because she's cute.
It's so nice that everyone came.
Maybe I should, uh, leave the two of you alone to catch up? Maybe you have some things to talk about.
Yes.
Yeah, there are.
Okay.
What What things? So, um [CLEARS THROAT] I think my mom explained to you how she got you released into emergency custody.
Yeah, she explained it.
The thing is that's only temporary.
And because you're not 18 for almost a year, once that expires, you become a ward of the state.
Yeah, the the social worker told me about that.
Okay, yeah.
And there's only two group homes in this county you'd be eligible for, and you couldn't finish school at Liberty and stuff.
And my parents I mean, me and my parents wanted to see if you might want them to adopt you.
[CHUCKLES] Wait, what? Like, adopt you into our family.
[STAMMERS] You mean, like, I'd be your brother? Well, I'm-I'm not familiar with all the lingo, but Wait.
Why are you asking me and not them? Because it was their idea, to be honest.
And at first, I thought it sounded, um idiotic.
And they left it up to me, seeing as I was the person who brought you in their life in the first place.
And maybe it's a good idea, so [JUSTIN CRYING] Are you - Are you crying? - [SNIFFLES] You know I'm, like, really fucked up, right? Well A, yes.
- [LAUGHS] - But you're clean and going to meetings.
And B, I'm also fucked up in certain ways, so Okay, yeah.
I'd like to be adopted, yeah.
Okay.
Cool.
[CLAY] Everything affects everything.
[SCHOOL BELL RINGS] Everyone affects everyone.
[CHATTER] [SIGHS] Fucking Tyler Down is back.
So? So, I wanna break his head open.
Yeah, that's a great idea at this particular time.
The field, the thing with Marcus He cost us our season.
We need to do something.
We are not gonna do a goddamn thing.
I'm on probation.
Right, I know.
I got you.
I'll take care of it.
Your father didn't beat you hard enough, 'cause you're still a fucking idiot.
The last time you tried to help, you almost fucked up my whole plea deal.
Well, none of it came back to you.
No one was gonna believe I didn't know about all the shit that you did.
I had to give you my goddamn lawyer.
I would've taken the fall if I had to.
I kept you clean.
What did you think would happen if you killed Clay Jensen in my car? I knew those kids could fuck everything up for us, and they did.
Well, you helped.
I Tell me what you want me to do.
- Okay? I'll make it right.
- I want you to leave it alone.
And leave me alone.
We're done.
[CYRUS] Mack said you guys had a good talk.
Yeah.
She's dating Eric now, huh? Yeah, that's cool.
You're okay, right? I mean, watching out for yourself? Those fucking jocks were not happy about the field and the season.
- Yeah.
I'll be careful.
- Good.
And you know about everything Yeah.
No, me, too.
Yeah.
- It got a little fucked up.
- [CHUCKLES] Yeah, totally.
Hey.
You know, being away, it was really good.
And I realized a lot of shit, so - You know.
- That's good, man.
- [CHUCKLES] - So, we're all right? Yeah, for sure.
- Cool.
[CHUCKLES] - Yeah.
Hey, maybe we could catch another show sometime.
I don't know, man.
I I don't think so.
But it's great to see that you're back and doing so well.
Yeah.
Thanks, man.
I mean, how are you even not crazy? I just [GROANS] It's insane, but it's, like, not a surprise, I guess.
And I-I just feel this peace that it's over.
So, it's over? No trial, no more legal stuff? Done? Done.
And I'm good.
Oh, what a fine parade Ready or not, call your name Hey, now, where do I go? [JUSTIN SIGHS] You gonna go to this dance? What, the Spring Fling thing? - Why in the world would I go to that? - I don't know.
It It might be fun? I don't go to dances.
You can go.
No.
I just thought that it'd be my first thing back and I could show people that I'm not, like, hiding or whatever.
[CLICKS TONGUE] Forget it.
Fuck.
Fine.
[SCOFFS] We'll go.
[CHUCKLES] I just thought since I hadn't heard from you after I told you about Lucas Yeah, I left you three messages.
[CHUCKLES] Yeah, and they didn't sound like you really wanted me to call back.
Okay, okay.
Seriously? I think you're used to people chasing you.
And you're used to getting away.
Maybe.
Well, you're not getting away.
I should be on my way.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for for having us.
I saw the store's for lease.
I'm moving to New York.
It was always Hannah's dream.
She never made it, so I'll get there for her.
I I wasn't sure if I should share this with you, but after hearing what you said, I think I think it's all right.
I found it on one of the old computers when I was cleaning up the store.
Hannah wrote it.
"Reasons why not.
" You're on there.
At least once, possibly twice.
Did did she call you "Helmet"? [CHUCKLES] Yeah, she did.
Eleven reasons.
She came up just short.
But she left so many out.
You know that, don't you? No matter how many reasons there might be "why," there are always more "why not.
" I do.
I wish I knew you when she was alive.
I wish you'd known me then, too.
Well bye.
Bye.
[DOOR OPENS] Why the fuck did you come back? I finished my program.
Yeah, you fucked up a lot of shit.
I'm sorry about everything.
- If I hurt you in any way - They canceled our fucking season.
I was acting out of a lot of anger and confusion.
- Oh, yeah? - And I'm going to do better.
And I hope that we can learn to talk to each other [GRUNTING] God! You ruined my fucking life, faggot! Get up! - [WATER BUBBLING] - [GROANING] [GASPS] I'm sorry! Please, I'm sorry! Hold him! [GASPING] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[GROANS] [SCREAMS] [SHRIEKS] [PANTING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [CLAY] We can get better.
We can do better.
But we still live in a world that is out to break us any way it can.
- Yo, so how's the car? - It's getting pretty close.
I've been working on it every hour I'm not in school and some when I should be in school.
[CHUCKLES] It was a beautiful car.
Hey, why don't we go to your place? - All right? - I think your place is closer.
I'm in the opposite direction.
- You don't want me to meet your family.
- It's not that.
I just need some time.
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow? Um, you know, I got some bullshit I gotta take care of.
Oh, some bullshit, like a dance? Yeah, Alex and Jess are going.
It's like a thing.
- Yeah, you see, that's bullshit.
- [LAUGHS] And I didn't wanna subject you to it, so I appreciate that.
[CHUCKLES] - You'll come by after? - Yes.
[ALEX] And my mom got me some game that's about being a flower or some shit.
- [LAUGHS] - I'm serious.
[CHUCKLES] But I talked my dad into driving since he won't let me drive for real yet.
- Excellent use of guilt, sir.
- Yeah, I thought so.
I beat off three times this morning.
I don't wanna know that.
Why would you tell me? 'Cause I thought you'd be happy for me.
Actually, I-I'm very happy for you.
That's, uh, impressive.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
I'm worried about dancing with Jess.
Like, I-I don't wanna go to the dance and just sit there, 'cause that's stupid.
And it doesn't get me closer to kissing her.
So I wanna dance with her, but I think I'll just fall over.
No, just, um, lean on her.
What, like, a middle school slow dance? That's so dumb.
No.
Just, you know, like, let her help.
Make it seem smooth.
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
You know, I am sick of your "poor-me" attitude.
- [CAR SCREECHES, CRASHES] - This one's easy.
Come on, get up.
No.
This is embarrassing.
This is embarrassing? - Yeah.
- Yeah, okay, you've done worse.
Come on, put the controller down.
Let's go.
Come on.
[GRUNTS] I have to school you - Okay.
- My mom made me do some dance Don't Never mind.
Don't even worry about that.
So, good hand on her waist.
- Left hand on her hip.
- Yeah.
She'll hold it and just lean into her.
- Okay? - What about? Just try stepping.
There you go.
All the way in there.
Yeah.
See? The song will have to be pretty slow, shouldn't it? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] So, it turns out the sushi place doesn't in fact deliver, so my dad and I are gonna pick it up.
You wanna come? Nah, I'm I'm good here.
These are kind of addictive.
[CHUCKLES] Yeah, right? You okay? You seem weird.
I think, maybe I'm happy.
Oh.
Cool.
Running around Is it really this fun When you're on my mind? Is it really this cool To be in your life? There's one thing I'll do If it ever goes wrong I'll write you into all of my songs And if suddenly I die I hope they will say That he was obsessed And it was okay 'Cause we're going downtown And we feel like running around And I'm going crazy Crazy for you Well? How was the first day back? Good.
It was good.
It was, um like, I had to adjust to everything, but it was great.
Yeah, there's a new guidance counselor, and she's totally smart, so - I think it's gonna work, Mom.
- That's great.
Oh, that's so great, Tyler.
Oh.
We are so proud of you.
[GROANS] [PANTS] [CRYING] Now bring that around to the right.
No, no, no, the big end.
- The big end.
- That's what I'm doing.
That's not what you're doing.
Oh, my God, start over.
- [SCOFFS] Would you fucking relax? - You You don't listen! You are so uptight.
I am not uptight.
It was your idea that we should wear ties.
It's not even a formal dance.
And if you wanna wear a tie, you should follow my instructions.
We really need to get you laid.
Shut up.
Start over.
Seriously, Jensen.
Okay? You help me tie a tie, I will help you get laid.
I don't need your help.
I I know.
I was just I was just saying.
I mean, you've had, like, a lot of sex, haven't you? Yeah, I've I've had a good amount.
Oh, I can't sleep at night Every second counts [CLAY] So, how do we survive? How do we bring light to a world that seems only dark? This is the first dance I haven't DJ'd in two years.
So now you get to dance.
Dude, people become DJs so they don't have to dance.
I thought it was because you had great taste in music.
That's just my gift to the world.
[MUSIC PLAYING] Good evening.
[LAUGHS] Good evening.
Did Did you do this? I got him a guest pass.
Apparently, you forgot to.
I didn't go to dances when I was in school because I felt so awkward dancing with girls.
It may seem like high school bullshit to you, but to me, it's finally being able to dance with my boyfriend.
If he will.
Of course I will.
- After bitching about the DJ.
- [LAUGHS] Yeah, me, too.
[CHATTERING] [ALEX] Hey.
Hey.
You guys look good.
Thanks.
Yeah, I bedazzled the cane, so I didn't, really.
Well, if we have to do this, let's do it.
Okay.
All right.
- You ready? - Yep.
All right.
[LAUGHS] I'm living inside my head I'm living inside my head - Tony.
Caleb.
Hey! - Hey, what's up? - Hi.
This is Tamika.
- Hey, Tamika.
- Hi, Tamika.
- Hi.
She's my girlfriend.

I wanna dance.
I just need to work up to it.
- You want a drink? - You know they're non-alcoholic.
Yeah, but any chance for sugar.
It feels good to be Running from the devil Another breath You would've been really good for Hannah.
I'm just saying.
Yeah? You know, if I didn't fuck it up like I fuck up everything else.
Dude, you do not wanna be having that contest with me.
["ROLLERCOASTER" PLAYING] I'm really sorry you couldn't talk to me.
Come on.
We gotta go in for this one! Okay, but it's full contact.
This dance desperately needs it.
- Yeah! - Fuck this.
Let's go.
Jensen, come on.
Are you about kicking ass or are you not? I'm It was summer when I saw your face I am.
I totally am.
Some killer queen you are Hey, come on.
If Jeff Atkins were here, he'd say, "Get your asses up and come on.
" Guys, come on! Come on! So come a little closer There is something I can tell ya You are such a rollercoaster And a killer queen you are [CLAY] How can we find joy in our lives in this world after Hannah? Come a little closer Why don't you come a little closer? Why don't you come a little closer? There's something I can tell ya Compared to them, I look all right.
Some killer queen you are Rollercoaster, I don't say no [CLAY] How do we take what hurts most? Take the darkness and turn it into light? Rollercoaster, I don't say no Rollercoaster, when you don't say no [CLAY] I think the answer is we love each other.
Some killer queen you are [CLAY] Easy to say.
But what do we do when it's hard to love? She thinks I've got a heart of stone Because I left her all alone Lonely tonight She thinks I'm gonna break her heart You want a real drink? No, thanks.
I'm good.
I don't have those emotions in me - [BRYCE] Brings back memories, huh? - I heard you were transferring.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna start over.
Lucky you.
I'm gonna miss this.
All of it.
You remember freshman year? The night before our first day, you stayed over.
We stayed up talking about how we were gonna be kings of this fucking school.
Yeah, I remember.
I'll always remember.
Me, too, brother.
[CLAY] Justin.
- You okay? - [BRYCE] He's fine.
I can't touch him.
Or you, or I go to jail.
Funny.
I don't have that problem.
[CHUCKLES] You're a good kid, Clay.
You need to get laid, but you're a good kid.

It's creepy.
I'm not alone anymore, am I? What's with these mats? They must have had a wrestling meet yesterday.
Wait, we have a wrestling team? - You were a cheerleader.
- Not for the wrestling team.
And I was a shitty cheerleader.
Yeah, you were.
- What? You said it.
- Still.
You look beautiful.
Sorry.
- For saying I look beautiful? - Yes.
So you're, like, living with Clay for real now, huh? Yeah.
They're adopting me.
Which, like, why anyone would wanna do that, I don't know.
I do.
Do you ever think about it? Doing what Hannah did? No.
I don't.
With everything that happened, I I never thought that was a way to go.
I've had some shitty days.
But - I always wanted to live.
- Yeah.
- I wanted to be alive.
- I know.
I wanna hold you When I'm not supposed to When I'm lying Close to someone else You're stuck in my head And I can't get you out of it I would do it all again I know I'd go back to you I'll go back to you - I'll go back to you - I'll go, I'll go back to you I'll go back to you I'll go back to you Cy, you better look at this.
I just got this text.
Jesus, Mack.
We can't let him do this.
We have to stop him.
We need to get out of here.
We need to call the cops.
- Agreed.
- If we do, his life is over.
His life is over either way.
He's either going to jail or he's dead.
Tyler doesn't wanna die.
I know he doesn't.
Where's Tony? - What's going on, guys? - Have you seen Jess? [TOILET FLUSHING] - Jess - Don't.
- Please? - What? What do you want? - I don't know what to do.
- Really? - You don't know what to do? - Jess, I'm pregnant.
[CLAY] The next time someone is in desperate need and they're about to make a terrible mistake, what do we do? Justin, find Jessica.
Get everyone you can.
Lock the doors, stay inside.
And don't call the police.
I gotta find Tony.
What the fuck? Clay! [CLAY] Do we look the other way? Do we just protect ourselves or do we help them? Do we do whatever we can to save them? I think I know what Hannah would want us to do.
Tyler! Tyler, what are you what are you doing? [TRUNK CLOSES] Get out of here, Clay.
Go home.
No.
No, I Don't Don't do this, Tyler.
You need to leave right now.
[STAMMERS] Tyler, please, listen to me.
You don't wanna do this.
I I know you don't.
You don't fucking know anything about me.
No.
No, I do.
I do know because I hurt, too.
I'm pissed off.
I didn't realize how bad it was for you.
And I'm sorry that I didn't.
- [JUSTIN] Clay! - I should've Hey, g-go back inside.
- Jesus, Clay! - Go inside! Get out of my fucking way.
Tyler, please.
Don't do it.
- I have to.
- No, you don't have to.
You can turn around.
- You can go home.
- [POLICE SIREN WAILING] Everybody knows already.
The only people that know are people who know you, and they wanna help you.
- Bullshit.
- No, look.
[STAMMERS] Tyler, they know you're hurting, we all are.
And I don't know what to do about it, either.
Okay? I tried hurting other people.
I tried hurting you, and it didn't fucking help, man.
It doesn't do any good.
Listen to me.
It doesn't! [SIRENS APPROACHING] Tyler, listen.
You don't get out of this alive.
And I don't want you to die.
I-I don't want you to die.
If you think this is the way, if you really think this'll change a goddamn thing and not just be another fucking tragedy that adults cry about for a week and then forget, if you really think this is gonna be different, then do what you gotta do.
Come on, Tyler.
Please? There's nothing else I can do.
There is.
We'll figure it out.
Okay? I swear.

It's okay.
Fuck.
Go, come on.
Come on.
Get in the car.
